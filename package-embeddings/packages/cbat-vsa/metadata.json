It works with CLP data structures that model intervals with precise boundary management, enabling operations such as signed/unsigned comparisons and modular arithmetic. These capabilities are particularly useful in static analysis and verification tasks requiring accurate tracking of value ranges in programs with cyclic or wrapped data.",
