It works with connection objects, transports, RPC implementations, and heartbeat configurations, enabling use cases like asynchronous client-server communication, remote method invocation with customizable RPC handlers, and network health monitoring through heartbeat mechanisms. Specific functions support exception-based error handling in clients and server-side connection management with graceful shutdown capabilities.",

It provides core operations for establishing connections, monitoring status, and handling incoming events, while the child module converts connection events into S-expressions for structured logging or debugging. Together, they enable reliable communication with backend services, reaction to server-side events, and detailed inspection of connection lifecycle changes using customizable serialization. Example uses include maintaining long-lived client-server links and tracing connection state transitions in logs.",

It provides types for request methods and response formats, and integrates with submodules that define structured query arguments, post body types like blobs and form data, and utilities for handling asynchronous client-side requests. Use it to fetch data from APIs with query strings, submit form data, or upload files using Blob payloads. The module combines direct functions for HTTP communication with specialized types in its submodules to cover core client-side networking tasks.",

It operates on connections, transports, and RPC handlers, allowing asynchronous client-server interactions, customizable remote method invocation, and network health tracking via heartbeat configurations. Users can implement RPC services with controlled shutdowns, monitor byte statistics, and handle errors through exception callbacks.
