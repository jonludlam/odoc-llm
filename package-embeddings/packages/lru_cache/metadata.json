It provides monadic interfaces for asynchronous or effectful value computation, allowing integration with external data sources or validation steps during cache access. Submodules define key comparison logic, cache initialization semantics, and monadic combinators for chaining cache operations, enabling use cases like memoizing HTTP responses, database queries, or parsed file contents while maintaining efficient memory usage. Specific examples include caching remote API results with on-demand loading or managing a bounded store of processed documents with automatic eviction of stale entries.",
