Supports building and combining results using 'a t and (a, b) result types, allowing for precise control over success and failure paths. Facilitates asynchronous task management by propagating errors through chained operations, ideal for reliable process execution. Examples include parsing input with error tracking, executing build steps with fallbacks, and managing distributed workflows with failure recovery.",
