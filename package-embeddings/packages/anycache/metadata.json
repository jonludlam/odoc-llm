It works with a key type and a monadic result type, supporting operations to create a new pending limit state and bind a key to a computation function. Concrete use cases include limiting parallel evaluation of expensive, concurrent cache misses in LRU or 2Q caching strategies.",

      "description": "This module coordinates asynchronous value computations for keys in a cache, ensuring that each key has at most one active computation at any time. It supports a key type and a monadic result type, providing operations to initialize a computation state and bind keys to their respective computation functions. It can be used to manage concurrent cache misses in eviction policies like LRU or 2Q, preventing redundant evaluations of expensive operations. For example, it ensures that multiple requests for the same uncached resource trigger only a single fetch, with all waiters receiving the result once it completes.",

It provides operations to construct successful (`return`) or failed (`fail`) results, and to chain computations using `>>?`, which sequences a computation with a function that handles both success and error outcomes. It is used to express error-aware, sequential computations within a caching context, such as handling cache lookups or updates that may fail due to external dependencies.",

Concrete use cases include caching results of expensive I/O operations, memoizing function calls with dynamic expiration, and managing cached values with custom validation rules.",

It supports cache creation with a fixed capacity, asynchronous retrieval with on-demand computation via `with_cache` or validation-aware updates via `with_validator`, and direct `get` and `set` operations.

It provides `return` and `fail` for wrapping values or exceptions, and the `>>?` operator for chaining operations with error propagation. It works with result values wrapped in a monadic type `'a t`, representing either a successful cache retrieval or an error. Use this module to sequence cache operations where each step depends on the result of the previous, handling both success and failure cases explicitly.",

It provides core operations like `create`, `get`, `set`, and `with_cache` for managing cached values with string keys and arbitrary, possibly deferred, result types. Submodules refine this behavior by introducing monadic error handling via `return` and `fail`, sequencing with `>>?`, and safe computation binding to manage retries or failures during cache population. Concrete uses include caching DNS responses, HTTP payloads, or file reads where values may require revalidation or asynchronous recomputation.",
