Works with strings and integer indices to process phonetic representations. Used for accurate name matching in applications like record linkage and search indexing.",

Processes ASCII and Unicode strings with integer indices to analyze and compare phonetic patterns. Supports tasks like record linkage by transforming names into standardized codes that reflect pronunciation. Examples include encoding \"Schmidt\" as \"SKMT\" with Soundex or \"SMT\" with double metaphone, and identifying vowels in \"Elena\" at index 0.",
