It defines versioned magic numbers for various file types and provides a function to exchange handshake messages, returning negotiated capabilities. It works with strings, input/output channels, and a record type encapsulating magic numbers for different source artifacts. A concrete use case is establishing a compatible communication channel during the initialization of a client-server session in a compiler toolchain.",
