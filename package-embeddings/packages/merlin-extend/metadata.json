      "description": "This module handles parsing and analysis of OCaml source buffers, providing operations to load buffers, extract abstract syntax trees (ASTs), and identify expressions or identifiers at specific positions. It supports interactive features like completion and type queries by parsing user input in context and optimizing ASTs for specific locations. The module works directly with lexing positions, parsetrees, and outcometrees to enable precise tooling such as type display, error reporting, and code navigation.",

      "description": "This module processes OCaml source code by parsing, loading, and pretty-printing buffers into structured forms like parsetrees and outcometrees, enabling tasks such as reading files, parsing interactive lines, and formatting output. It provides core operations for buffer manipulation, expression identification at specific positions, and AST extraction, while its child module enhances these capabilities with context-aware parsing, type queries, and optimized AST transformations. Together, they support precise tooling features like code navigation, error reporting, and type display by working directly with lexing positions and structured syntax trees. Example uses include loading and parsing source files, extracting expressions at cursor positions in an editor, and formatting OCaml code or toplevel responses for display.",

It operates on types such as `Parsetree.extension`, `Parsetree.attribute`, and `Location.t`, enabling precise control over how specific code regions are processed or displayed. Concrete use cases include generating syntax error placeholders, marking nodes to be hidden or focused in IDEs, and extracting location information for error reporting.",

It integrates logging via `notify` and `debug`, structured identification with name and version fields, and binary data parsing using a versioned reader interface. You can define component metadata, log runtime events, decode binary formats, and negotiate protocol capabilities during extension startup. Concrete use cases include bootstrapping plugins with custom arguments, parsing network protocols, and managing versioned file formats.",
