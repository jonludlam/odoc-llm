It works with virtual DOM trees, OCaml models/messages, and JavaScript objects using Ojs.t, enabling concrete applications to render to real DOM containers and handle user interactions. Concrete use cases include building interactive web UIs with strong typing, handling form input changes, implementing custom DOM components, and integrating with JavaScript libraries through safe value marshaling.",

It works directly with `Vdom.js_object` and primitive types like strings, numbers, and booleans, while providing structured error handling for robust parsing of dynamic data. Typical use cases include transforming JSON-like structures from external sources into typed OCaml representations and validating untrusted input in web applications.",
