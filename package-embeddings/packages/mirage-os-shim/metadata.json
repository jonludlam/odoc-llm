It handles boolean flags, Lwt threads, and 64-bit time values to control termination, setup, and delays. Users can initiate graceful shutdowns, register setup/teardown functions, and pause execution with high precision. Examples include terminating services on command, preparing environments before starting a loop, and introducing non-blocking delays in event-driven code.",

It supports registering setup and teardown functions, initiating controlled termination, and inserting precise, non-blocking delays. Users can coordinate service termination, prepare environments before event loops, and manage timing in reactive systems. Operations include triggering shutdowns, scheduling delays, and executing pre-loop initialization routines.",
