      "description": "This module provides Git-based versioned storage with typed references, enabling branching, merging, and atomic commits over key-value data. It supports structured data versioning through typed reference management, in-memory backends, and read-write stores. Submodules handle commit metadata (author, message, timestamp), branch management (tracking and updating branch heads), cryptographic hashing (HMAC, hash sets/maps), and merge operations for contents and nodes. You can model commit history as a DAG with labeled edges and vertices, compute cryptographic digests for integrity verification, and perform conflict-free merges of structured data like configuration files or versioned documents.",
