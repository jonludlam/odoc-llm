It operates on test cases represented as monadic functions, organized into labeled suites and evaluated programmatically without command-line interfaces. Key operations include defining tests with `test_case`, running them with `run`, and listing tests with `list_tests`, all while integrating with concurrency monads like Lwt or Async. It enables embedding test execution in custom environments, composing test suites, and controlling test behavior through configuration and speed annotations.",

It works with basic system types like strings, floats, file descriptors, and standard output streams. Concrete use cases include setting up colored output for test runners, redirecting logs to files, measuring test durations, and determining terminal properties like width for formatting test results.",

It defines core operations like `return`, `bind`, and `catch` over a monadic type `'a t`, supporting both pure and effectful computations through submodules that implement identity, list, and asynchronous behaviors. For example, `bind` chains test steps with setup and teardown, `fold_map_s` processes lists of test cases with shared state, and async extensions allow non-blocking test actions to be composed sequentially. These capabilities unify pure and effectful test logic into a single, expressive framework for building and composing test suites.",

It defines data types for test cases, configurations, and source positions, supporting operations like assertions, test construction, and programmatically controlled execution flows. Users can create custom testable types, run filtered test suites from the command line, or integrate structured tests into asynchronous workflows. Example uses include defining a test suite with `test_case`, running it with a custom CLI parser, or executing labeled tests programmatically with speed-based filtering.",
