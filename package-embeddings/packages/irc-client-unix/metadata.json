It manages connection state with `connection_t`, parses raw messages, and supports persistent connections via `reconnect_loop`. You can build IRC bots that react to channel events, send messages, or maintain reliable TCP connections to IRC servers. Key operations include connecting to a server, sending commands, and processing messages in real-time.",
