Custom types include cache settings, secret parameters, and build specifications, with operations to mount, encode, and generate artifacts. Cache instances can be initialized with target paths, secrets can be configured with identifiers and buildkit options, and Dockerfiles can be produced with proper exclusion handling. Examples include persisting build states, securing container secrets, and generating platform-aware build instructions.",
