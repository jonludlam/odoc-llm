      "description": "The module offers functions for constructing and manipulating type representations, including tuple creation (e.g., 4, 5, or 6 elements) and argument list combinators, alongside type abstractions for handling complex data. It works with core types like integers, floats, and strings, as well as custom data structures, enabling precise type management in statement execution or row extraction scenarios. Specific use cases include building structured arguments for database queries or parsing row-based data formats with nested tuples.",

Works with a polymorphic type 'a t representing a cursor over a potentially infinite or large data source. Enables efficient iteration, mapping, and conversion to lists or sequences, with specialized functions to retrieve single elements or ignore the cursor entirely.",

It includes polymorphic cursor types for lazy sequences and functions for tuple construction, argument list management, and data extraction. Users can build complex query arguments, parse nested row data, and efficiently process large datasets. Examples include creating multi-element tuples for parameterized queries and converting cursor results into lists or transformed sequences.",
