It works with integer values wrapped in a constant type provided by the parameter module `S`. These constants are used when creating and binding Unix domain sockets to configure address structures correctly.",

It represents these values using a typed constant interface, ensuring correct usage when configuring socket address structures. Developers can use these constants to properly bind and create Unix domain sockets with valid path lengths and address families. For example, `AF_UNIX` is used to specify the address family when creating a socket, and `SUN_PATH_LEN` ensures paths do not exceed system limits.",

It supports creating, manipulating, and serializing socket address information for use in system calls such as binding or connecting to Unix domain sockets. The `sockaddr_un_t` value facilitates low-level interaction with socket APIs, enabling tasks like setting up communication endpoints or retrieving peer addresses. Example uses include defining socket paths, configuring address families, and preparing address structures for inter-process communication.",
