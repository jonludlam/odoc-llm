It manages parsing and serialization of S-expression-based config files through versioned submodules (V0 to V3), enabling backward-compatible upgrades and structured I/O operations. You can customize diff behavior using thresholds, context sizes, and formatting flags, or persist configurations to disk with built-in defaults. Each version submodule handles specific schema requirements, such as converting V1 to V2 or writing structured output in V3.",

You can use it to generate diffs of file contents, compare directory trees while excluding specific files, or check whether two strings or files are identical. The main interface provides direct comparison functions, while the submodule enables detailed, structured diff analysis.",
