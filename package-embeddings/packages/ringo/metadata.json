      "description": "Manages bounded, FIFO collections with operations to add, remove, and inspect elements, including adding lists, clearing, and folding over contents in both oldest-to-newest and newest-to-oldest orders. Works with a generic type 'a t, representing a fixed-capacity buffer that automatically discards the oldest element when full. Used to track recent events, maintain a history of actions, or limit memory usage by enforcing a maximum number of stored items.",

Supports adding, removing, and iterating over elements while maintaining a fixed capacity. Enables efficient memory usage by allocating nodes on demand and allows retrieval of oldest or newest elements, as well as folding over the collection in both directions.",

It supports adding elements with weight constraints, automatically evicting older elements when necessary, and retrieving elements in order from oldest to newest or vice versa. Works with a custom type 'a t and handles weighted insertion, removal, and traversal of elements.",

It works with a structured data type 'a t, utilizing 'a node records to track elements and their usage history while maintaining precise length control. Use cases include optimizing memory-constrained systems, such as in caching layers for databases or web servers, where efficient eviction of infrequently accessed data is critical.",

      "description": "The module provides operations for managing a FIFO buffer with sloppy accounting, including insertion, removal, and promotion of elements within a typed node structure and collection. It is designed for cache implementations requiring FIFO replacement, where removed elements remain counted toward the size limit until sufficient new elements are added, making it suitable for scenarios prioritizing performance over strict size accuracy.",

It works with elements of type 'a stored in internal node structures, ensuring precise accounting where removed elements do not affect size constraints. It is designed for applications requiring strict FIFO eviction, such as implementing caches with accurate size management and tracking element age during read/write operations.",

It works with a cache structure (`'a t`) and nodes (`'a node`), where `promote_read` and `promote_write` update access status to prioritize recently used elements. Use cases include optimizing memory usage in systems requiring efficient eviction of low-priority data, such as caching layers in resource-constrained environments.",
