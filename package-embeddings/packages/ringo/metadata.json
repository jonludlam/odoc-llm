It supports operations to add elements with their weights, automatically evicting older elements to make space, and returning the evicted values. Use cases include implementing bounded caches where items have variable memory footprints or managing resource pools with weighted limits.",

It supports insertion, removal, and promotion operations that dynamically evict the least recently used elements when adding new entries would exceed the capacity. This design is particularly useful for caching systems handling variable-sized data, such as image thumbnails or serialized payloads, where memory usage must be strictly controlled.",

It provides functions to fold over the elements in either direction, inspect the oldest and newest elements, and manage buffer contents with precise control over capacity and weight limits. Concrete use cases include managing a capped history of weighted events, such as tracking recent user actions with varying importance or maintaining a fixed-size cache of prioritized data.",
