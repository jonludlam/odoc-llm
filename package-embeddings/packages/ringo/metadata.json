It supports operations to add elements, remove specific or oldest/newest elements, promote elements to adjust their position, and fold over elements in either order. The buffer is designed for building caches with FIFO replacement policies, where promotions reflect access patterns to influence eviction.",

It supports precise control over element promotion for cache-like access patterns, with operations to add, remove, and reorder elements, and provides direct access to the oldest and newest elements. Concrete use cases include building caches with FIFO-based eviction policies and managing streaming data with bounded memory usage.",

      "description": "This module manages a cache where entries are evicted based on cumulative weight rather than element count, supporting dynamic capacity adjustments through operations like insertion, removal, and access-based promotion. It works with entries that associate keys to values and explicit weight values, organizing them to prioritize recently accessed items while enforcing weight limits. Ideal for scenarios like memory-constrained caches storing variable-sized resources (e.g., images, serialized objects) where eviction must account for heterogeneous storage costs.",

It supports operations to add elements with automatic eviction of the oldest when capacity is exceeded, remove elements from either end, and fold over elements in either newest-first or oldest-first order. Concrete use cases include caching recent values with limited memory, tracking recent events or logs, and implementing sliding windows over data streams.",

It supports operations to add elements with their weight, automatically evicting older elements if necessary to make space, and returning the evicted values. Use cases include managing memory-limited caches where items have variable sizes, such as caching network responses with byte sizes or storing variable-length buffers.",

It tracks elements using nodes, where each node holds a value and maintains insertion order. Operations include adding elements (with optional return of evicted values), removing specific or oldest/newest elements, promoting nodes to update their position, and folding over elements in age order. It is suitable for building caches where access patterns determine which items stay in memory, such as HTTP response caching or database query result buffering.",
