Operates with types representing command arguments, environment maps, and mount configurations. Used to isolate processes for secure execution of untrusted code or to enforce resource constraints during builds.",

It operates on a `conf` type to define sandbox parameters and supports operations such as symlink creation, directory changes, and process execution with explicit I/O handling. Use cases include securely running untrusted code, restricting resource access, and ensuring process containment in restricted execution scenarios.",
