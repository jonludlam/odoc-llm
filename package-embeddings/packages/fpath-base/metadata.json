    {

      "description": "This module enables structured manipulation of absolute file paths through operations like construction from strings or existing paths, component-based composition, normalization to resolve redundancies, and analysis to extract elements like parent directories. It provides robust comparison capabilities, including ordering, equality checks, and hashing, along with utilities for sorting and clamping paths within a directory hierarchy. These features are designed for tasks such as file system navigation, path validation, and hierarchical data processing where type-safe path handling is critical.",

It works with path segment values (`Fsegment.t`) representing directory names, filenames, or special markers like `\".\"` and `\"..\"`, supporting equality checks, lexicographic ordering, and bounded value adjustments. Typical uses include normalizing path elements, sorting filesystem paths, or enforcing constraints in structured data representations.",

It provides comparison and hashing capabilities for ordering and integrating paths into hash-based collections. Typical use cases include dynamic path assembly, validation, and sorting or grouping paths in data structures requiring equivalence checks.",

It supports structured operations such as path construction, normalization, comparison, and component extraction, working with dedicated types like `Absolute_path.t`, `Relative_path.t`, and `Fsegment.t`. Concrete use cases include validating and navigating directory hierarchies, assembling and sanitizing file paths dynamically, and performing type-safe path comparisons and transformations.",
