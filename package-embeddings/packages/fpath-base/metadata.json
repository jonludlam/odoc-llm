It works with path segment values (`Fsegment.t`), supporting use cases like path traversal validation, ordered collection construction, and hash-based deduplication while ensuring consistency with string representations and special filenames such as `.` and `..`.",

It supports operations like segment manipulation, directory traversal, extension handling, and absolute/relative path classification, while providing comparison, hashing, and string conversion utilities. Typical use cases include cross-platform path validation, file system traversal, and manipulating paths during build processes or configuration management.",

It operates on the `Fpath_base.Absolute_path.t` type, supporting conversions to strings and `Fpath.t`, while offering robust comparison logic for equality, ordering, and range operations. Typical applications include path validation, hierarchical comparisons (e.g., subtree containment), and integrating paths into ordered or hashed collections like sets and maps.",

      "description": "This module provides a comprehensive system for handling file paths with precise, platform-aware semantics. It centers around three core types: `Fsegment.t` for individual path segments, `Fpath.t` for general file paths, and `Absolute_path.t` for normalized absolute paths, each supporting operations like construction, comparison, normalization, and string conversion. Key capabilities include path traversal validation, segment manipulation, extension handling, and hierarchical containment checks, enabling tasks like cross-platform path analysis, ordered collection construction, and hash-based deduplication. Examples include validating relative paths in a build system, normalizing user-provided file paths, and checking whether one path resides within a directory subtree.",
