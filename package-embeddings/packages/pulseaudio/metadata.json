Operates on float arrays or bigarrays, enabling operations like draining, flushing, and querying latency. Allows setting buffer lengths, pre-buffering for playback, and fragment sizes for recording. Supports real-time audio processing by adjusting stream parameters and handling data flow efficiently.",
