      "description": "This module enables bidirectional JSON serialization and deserialization for OCaml types, supporting primitives (integers, floats, strings), structured data (records, variants, options, lists, arrays), and low-level representations like `bytes` and `unit`. It operates on `Yojson.Safe.t` values, offering explicit error handling through functions like `try_with` and `make_error`, while providing utilities to convert to and from direct Yojson representations. These capabilities facilitate robust data interchange, structured configuration parsing, and error-resilient integration with JSON-based APIs or storage formats.",

      "description": "This module facilitates bidirectional conversion between OCaml values and JSON representations, emphasizing structured data transformations like records, variants, and tuples, alongside standard data structures (lists, arrays, options) and primitive types (integers, strings, booleans). It operates on `Yojson.Safe.t` values and OCaml types, incorporating error handling for robust parsing and generation, including edge cases for lazy values, results, and bytes. Typical applications include serializing complex domain models to JSON for API interchange, deserializing external JSON payloads into typed OCaml structures, and managing configuration data with strict type safety and error diagnostics.",

It provides explicit error handling for conversion failures and facilitates JSON-to-JSON transformations, catering to use cases in API development, configuration management, and cross-system data interchange. Additional support for standard wrappers like `Result` and `lazy` values ensures robust serialization of complex or deferred computations.",
