It supports constructing services for standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH, PUT) with precise path routing and parameter handling, enabling the creation of strongly-typed RESTful APIs. Concrete use cases include defining API endpoints with specific path hierarchies, encoding request inputs and outputs, and generating request builders for client-side API consumption.",

It handles the final step of service execution by packaging outputs into a format suitable for transmission over a network.

It operates on typed directory structures that map endpoints to service handlers, using combinators to enforce static guarantees and encodings for request/response processing. Typical applications include building RESTful APIs with introspection capabilities and servers that dynamically generate subdirectories based on request patterns.",
