      "description": "This module enables the construction and manipulation of audio/video filter chains, operating on filter graphs to create and link filter instances with configurable properties like pixel format, frame rate, and channel layout. It supports complex media workflows such as real-time video effects and audio resampling, with child modules handling audio conversion by transforming sample rate, channel layout, and audio format. Main data types include filter graphs, filter instances, and audio parameters, with operations for linking filters and configuring media properties. For example, you can build a video filter chain to change frame rate or apply effects, or use the audio submodule to resample audio to a different format during transcoding.",
