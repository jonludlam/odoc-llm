It operates on audio frames using the `audio_converter` type, configured with input and output parameters like sample rate, channel layout, and sample format. It is used to process audio data through pipelines that require format transformations, such as adjusting sample rates for playback or converting between audio encodings for compression.",

It operates on filter properties such as time base, frame rate, pixel format, and channel layout, while also handling audio conversion workflows requiring resampling and format adjustments. Key applications include building complex media processing pipelines, applying dynamic filter effects, and ensuring compatibility between audio streams through format conversion.",
