It supports functional transformations (map, filter, fold), sequence integration (conversion to/from sets), and safe/unsafe variants for error handling during element queries. These features are useful for scenarios requiring precise set algebra, ordered data aggregation, or interoperability between sets, lists, and sequences.",
