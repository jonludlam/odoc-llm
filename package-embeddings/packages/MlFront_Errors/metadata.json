It provides functions to raise and chain syntax-related errors with contextual messages, using result types that include `Error (`Msg _)` or `Error `ErrorCaptured`. Concrete use cases include validating token streams, checking AST node consistency, and signaling malformed input during compiler front-end stages.",
