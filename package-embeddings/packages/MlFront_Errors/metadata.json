It provides functions to add structured diagnostic messages and control when they are printed using `protect` and `pp`. Concrete use cases include collecting and displaying detailed error diagnostics during parsing or type-checking phases, and conditionally raising exceptions after error accumulation.",

It works with `result` values where errors are either a message (`Msg`) or a captured error (`ErrorCaptured`). These operators are used to sequence operations that may fail, allowing concise error handling in parsers or interpreters where different error cases must be distinguished and propagated.",

It supports data types like `Msg` and `ErrorCaptured`, along with operations to add, track, and conditionally raise errors, and to bind and transform `result` values. You can use it to collect detailed error contexts during parsing or type-checking, and to sequence operations that propagate distinct error cases through monadic combinators.",
