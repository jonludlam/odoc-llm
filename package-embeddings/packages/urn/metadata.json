It provides `compare`, `zero`, `add`, `sub`, and `sample` functions tailored to `float` values using `Random.float` for sampling. Concrete use cases include implementing weighted random selection with floating-point precision, such as simulating probabilistic distributions or managing weighted item pools.",
