It supports checking type definitions, retrieving names, and ensuring consistency during type checking, while also handling data serialization and conversion for configuration processing. Functions include type equality checks, value comparison, and representation conversion. For example, it can verify if a type is properly declared or convert a string input to a boolean flag for runtime use.",
