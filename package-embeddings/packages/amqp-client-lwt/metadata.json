Examples include publishing a message to an exchange, acknowledging receipt of a delivered message, configuring prefetch limits for consumers, and recovering unacknowledged messages after a failure. Specific behaviors like requeuing, rejecting, or canceling consumers are controlled through flags and structured requests tied to the AMQP protocol.",
