It operates on AMQP protocol primitives like delivery tags, class IDs, and method-specific tables, alongside strings and integers to encode messaging semantics. These components enable reliable message delivery, transactional grouping, resource configuration, and state synchronization in AMQP clients requiring low-level protocol control.",
