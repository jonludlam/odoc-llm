It uses a custom folder type to accumulate results during iteration, enabling precise control over text transformation or analysis. This allows for tasks like validating encoding, extracting specific characters, or building structured data from raw text. Examples include counting valid code points, detecting invalid sequences, or generating position-aware output.",
