It supports creation, comparison, and propagation of dual numbers through operations like addition, multiplication, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions (`cosh`, `tanh`), while leveraging dual algebra for automatic differentiation. Specific applications include numerical root-finding via Newton's method and tasks requiring precise derivative calculations, such as optimization or sensitivity analysis.",
