      "description": "This module provides streamlined operations for parsing JSON from strings and channels, converting OCaml primitives and structures to JSON values, and serializing JSON to outputs like strings or buffers. It operates on JSON values represented as `value` and `t` types, offering type-safe accessors for primitives (e.g., booleans, integers) and collections (e.g., lists, dictionaries), alongside path-based navigation for structured data extraction. Designed for simplicity, it suits scripting tasks such as configuration parsing, lightweight API response handling, or data transformation workflows where direct, error-resilient conversions between JSON and OCaml representations are prioritized over granular control.",
