It operates exclusively on standard OCaml lists of any type. These functions are useful when working with fixed-length lists where positional access is required, such as parsing structured input or handling tuples encoded as lists.",

      "description": "This module provides operations for constructing, parsing, and transforming S-expressions (sexps), including conversions to and from primitive types (integers, floats, strings) and list-based manipulation. It works with atomic values, nested lists of sexps, and token sequences, supporting in-place list updates and error-resilient parsing from string representations. Typical use cases include deserializing structured configuration data, building domain-specific syntax trees, and implementing interpreters or compilers that require robust S-expression handling.",

It operates on hierarchical sexp values, standard lists, and primitive types like integers and strings, enabling bidirectional conversion and precise deconstruction. Typical applications include parsing structured text formats, implementing domain-specific languages, and extracting typed values from nested data representations using declarative patterns.",
