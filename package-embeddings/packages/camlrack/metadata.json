It operates on a custom S-expression type paired with token lists and leverages standard error handling types for robust parsing. Typical applications include configuration file interpretation, DSL implementation, and structured data serialization.",

      "description": "This module enables pattern matching and conversion for S-expressions, supporting operations like parsing primitives, extracting values, and matching structured data against declarative patterns. It includes submodules for positional list access, allowing retrieval of elements by index\u2014such as first, second, or ninth\u2014along with the tail after the first element. The core API handles S-expression transformations and validation, while the submodules facilitate working with fixed-length lists, making it suitable for parsing and processing structured or nested data formats. Examples include extracting integers from an S-expression list, validating the shape of nested structures, or decoding tuples encoded in lists.",
