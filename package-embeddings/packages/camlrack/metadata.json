      "description": "This module offers bidirectional conversion between S-expressions and primitive data types (strings, integers, floats) as well as list operations, alongside parsing utilities for token streams and error handling. It works with S-expressions, tokens, and parse errors, enabling tasks like serializing structured data or processing input with robust error reporting. Specific use cases include transforming raw input into abstract syntax trees or validating and converting heterogeneous data formats.",

Supports lists of any type with operations like fetching the first, second, or ninth element. Allows structured processing without pattern matching or recursion. For example, it can isolate the third element while preserving the rest of the list for further manipulation.",
