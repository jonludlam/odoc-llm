It provides direct APIs for initiating SSH connections over TCP, managing authentication parameters with `Mimic.ctx` contexts, and performing concrete actions like cloning or pushing repositories securely. Submodules handle connection setup, integration with Mirage's networking stack, and key-based authentication workflows. Example usage includes securely cloning a remote Git repository over SSH within a unikernel using a private key or username-password pair.",
