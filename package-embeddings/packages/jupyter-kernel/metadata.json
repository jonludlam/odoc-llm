It works with abstract syntax trees, MIME data bundles, and protocol-specific request types like `inspect_request` and `history_request`. Concrete use cases include building domain-specific language kernels, embedding interpreters, or integrating with REPL-based systems.",

It works with data structures representing execution control (e.g., `execute_request`, `execute_reply`), introspection (e.g., `inspect_request`), kernel lifecycle management (e.g., `shutdown`, `interrupt_reply`), and output handling (e.g., `pyout`, `display_data`). These functions enable bidirectional conversion between OCaml values and JSON payloads for use cases like handling code execution requests, reporting errors, supporting code completion, and exchanging connection metadata between frontends and kernels.",
