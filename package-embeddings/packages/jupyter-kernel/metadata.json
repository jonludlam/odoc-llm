It works with data types such as MIME bundles, execution status, completion metadata, and protocol-specific request types. Concrete use cases include building a custom language kernel for Jupyter that supports evaluation, syntax checking, auto-completion, and rich display output.",

      "description": "This module orchestrates communication with a Jupyter kernel, handling message serialization and ZeroMQ transport for sending execution requests and receiving rich mime-typed outputs. It supports direct operations like evaluating code, capturing results, and streaming execution output, while its child module enables implementing custom kernels with features like code evaluation, auto-completion, and rich display. Key data types include execution status, MIME bundles, and protocol-specific requests, allowing both client interaction and kernel implementation with consistent messaging semantics. Use it to embed Jupyter execution in an application or build a new language kernel with full protocol support.",

It defines a polymorphic variant type `content` representing various message payloads such as execution requests, status updates, and I/O streams, along with functions to convert between JSON and these content types. Key operations include `make`, `send`, and `recv` for building, sending, and receiving messages over ZeroMQ sockets, used to implement communication between the kernel and clients.",

It provides functions to open and close these sockets based on connection info, send heartbeat signals, and dump messages from a socket to a stream. Concrete use cases include establishing bidirectional communication with Jupyter kernels, relaying execution commands, and managing real-time output publication.",

It operates on protocol-specific types like execution requests/replies, inspection payloads, history queries, code completion responses, and connection metadata, using `Yojson.Safe` and `Buffer.t` for efficient parsing and generation. Key use cases include managing code execution workflows, error reporting, interactive help features, and connection lifecycle operations in Jupyter notebook environments.",
