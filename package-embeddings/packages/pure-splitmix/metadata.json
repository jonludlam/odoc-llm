It provides functions for mixing and transforming 64-bit integers, including population count, two variants of 64-bit mixing, and a gamma value transformation. These operations are used internally to generate high-quality random values and ensure proper state splitting and seeding.",

      "description": "This module provides a purely functional interface for a splittable pseudorandom number generator, allowing deterministic creation of independent random streams through state-based operations. It centers around the `t` state type, which is transformed using bit manipulation and hashing functions from its child module to generate random integers, booleans, and other values while maintaining purity. The generator can be initialized from a seed, string, or system source, making it suitable for parallel computations and reproducible testing. Example usage includes splitting a single state into multiple independent generators or producing a sequence of random integers with guaranteed state isolation.",
