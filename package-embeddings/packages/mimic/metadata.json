Concrete use cases include implementing custom HTTP servers or clients, middleware, and network services that require low-level protocol control.",

It works with argument types that represent required, optional, and default values, along with mappings from key-based argument collections. These operations are used to define how functions consume values when building evaluators or interpreters for expressions.",

It introduces context-aware evaluation frameworks using typed witnesses for binding and merging values, alongside protocol composition systems that resolve domain-specific flows for endpoint connections. Key applications include building expression evaluators, managing network protocol lifecycles, and dynamically composing protocol stacks in context-driven environments.",
