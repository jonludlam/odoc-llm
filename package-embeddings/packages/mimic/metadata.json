It supports operations like reading data into buffers, writing single or multiple buffers, and shutting down or closing connections gracefully. It is used for implementing network protocols over transports like TCP or UDP, where precise control over data transmission and connection lifecycle is required.",

It is used to represent and manipulate structured data within a larger data processing pipeline, enabling integration of custom data forms into flow-based computations. Concrete use cases include modeling domain-specific values like configuration settings, parsed expressions, or intermediate representation nodes.",

It supports reading headers, writing responses, and managing connections through a set of operations that allow precise control over data transmission and lifecycle management. The child module extends this capability by offering low-level network communication primitives for reading, writing, and closing connections, enabling custom protocol implementations over TCP or UDP. Example uses include building lightweight HTTP servers, proxies, or network services that require fine-grained control over I/O and connection handling.",

It supports dynamic protocol instantiation and stateful connection management through operations like `read`, `write`, and `shutdown`, enabling adaptive network stacks and runtime dependency resolution. The module integrates custom data types into flow-based pipelines, merges structured values from multiple sources using context-aware strategies, and provides primitives for implementing HTTP-like protocols with precise I/O control. It also includes utilities for constructing validated function arguments, supporting required, optional, and default parameter patterns in route handlers or configuration parsers.",
