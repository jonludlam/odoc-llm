Operates on flow endpoints, Cstruct buffers, and custom error types for network operations. Used to manage TCP-like communication, ensuring proper buffer handling and connection termination in networked applications.",

Works with polymorphic argument types that associate keys with values or options. Used to build configuration-like data structures where specific keys must be resolved or defaulted during processing.",

Operates on custom data structures defined by the module, such as structured data containers and stateful objects. Used to duplicate complex object hierarchies in testing scenarios and to ensure consistent state representation across different components.",
