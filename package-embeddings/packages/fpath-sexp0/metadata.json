      "description": "This module offers operations for managing normalized relative file paths, including appending, chopping, and normalizing paths by eliminating empty segments to enforce relative path constraints. It operates on a dedicated type `t` derived from `Fpath.t`, supporting comparisons, hashing, and bidirectional conversion to strings or list representations. These capabilities are particularly useful for safely constructing and validating relative paths in contexts like configuration parsing or dynamic path assembly.",

      "description": "This module offers comprehensive path manipulation capabilities centered on `Fpath.t` values, focusing on construction, normalization, and component extraction while handling platform-specific conventions like directory separators and volume identifiers. It supports operations for path analysis, including relativization, classification (absolute/relative), extension management, and safe string conversions, ensuring consistent normalization and comparison. These tools are particularly useful for cross-platform file system operations, path validation, and building robust path transformations in applications like build systems or configuration loaders.",

      "library": "fpath-sexp0",
      "description": "This module provides operations for constructing, normalizing, and manipulating absolute file paths as a validated type `t`, which wraps `Fpath.t`. It supports appending path segments, trimming prefixes/suffixes, converting to/from strings and relative paths, and enforcing trailing slashes, while ensuring all paths are absolute and normalized. These capabilities are useful for safely resolving relative paths against a root directory, building robust file system abstractions, or handling configuration paths where correctness and type safety are critical.",

It provides functions to convert between strings and validated segments, compare and hash segments, and access common predefined segments like `.` and `..`. Concrete use cases include safely constructing and manipulating file paths in Unix-like systems, and identifying version control directories such as `.git` and `.hg`.",

      "description": "This module provides a suite of utilities for working with normalized relative and absolute file paths, offering precise control over path construction, normalization, and component manipulation. It introduces dedicated types for validated paths and path segments, supporting operations such as appending, relativizing, trimming, and converting to and from strings or lists while enforcing correctness constraints like absence of empty segments or invalid characters. Key functionalities include safe path assembly, extension management, segment validation, and cross-platform normalization, making it suitable for applications like build systems, configuration loaders, and file system abstractions where path integrity is essential. Example uses include resolving a relative path against a root directory, validating and manipulating version control paths, and constructing normalized file paths for Unix-like systems.",
