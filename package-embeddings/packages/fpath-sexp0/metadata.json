Its functionality is particularly valuable in contexts requiring precise relative path management, such as file system traversal, resource resolution, or configuration file handling.",

It provides functions to convert between strings and validated segments, compare and hash segments, and access predefined segments like `\".\"`, `\"..\"`, `.git`, and `.hg`. Use cases include safely constructing and manipulating file paths and filtering version control directories.",

It supports conversions to and from strings and relative paths (`Fpath.t`), path resolution against a root directory, and transformations like appending, truncating, or ensuring directory suffixes, while enforcing validity through strict validation on construction. These capabilities are particularly useful for applications requiring robust path handling, such as file system utilities, configuration loaders, or build tools that must resolve relative paths in a known root context.",
