Key data types include output destinations (`Pty`), connection lifecycle states, connection records with device paths and domain IDs, and low-level channel metadata with integer references and file descriptors. Operations allow conversion to string and association list formats, supporting serialization and configuration workflows. For example, a connection record can represent a console link between virtual devices, while state transitions track session initialization and closure.",
