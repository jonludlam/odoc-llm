It includes specialized functions like `on_error` and `on_error_msg` to handle and log `result` values that return `Error`, allowing custom formatting and error recovery. These functions are useful for tracking DNSSEC validation failures, parsing errors, or other runtime issues with structured logging and tagging support.",

      "description": "The module provides cryptographic operations and validation routines for DNSSEC, handling key parsing, signature verification, and chain construction over DNSSEC data structures like DNSKEYs, RRSIGs, and NSEC records. It works with zone data representations such as domain name maps, DNS packet replies, and key metadata sets to enable secure response validation, non-existence proofs via NSEC/NSEC3 chains, and trust chain establishment during DNS resolution. Specific use cases include verifying signed DNS responses, validating DS records for delegation, and resolving wildcards while ensuring cryptographic integrity.",

It provides an alphabet configuration for encoding, functions to convert between raw strings and Base32 representations, and support for optional padding during encoding and decoding. Use it to generate Base32 strings from binary data or parse Base32 input into raw bytes, such as for generating or validating API keys or short identifiers.",
