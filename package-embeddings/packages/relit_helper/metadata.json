Processes integer literals and segment markers to construct expressions, while comparing strings with positional data to ensure tokenization accuracy. Supports code transformation by generating syntactic structures and debugging mismatches via line and column tracking. Enables verification of parsed outputs against original inputs and facilitates precise error detection in lexical analysis.",
