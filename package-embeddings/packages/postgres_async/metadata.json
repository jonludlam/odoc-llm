Its `Table` submodule handles hash tables keyed by channels, supporting association lists, grouping, and binary serialization for async client state management, while a `Of_sexp` submodule converts S-expressions into tables using a specified key module. The `Hash_queue` submodule provides a hybrid hash-table and queue structure for O(1) keyed operations with ordered traversal, useful for managing async channels with priority or order constraints. The `Hash_set` submodule offers set operations on channels, including creation, equality checks, S-expression and binary serialization, supporting use cases like tracking active channels and unique subscriptions.",
