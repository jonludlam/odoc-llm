It provides functions to get the current time, clock period, and time zone offset in seconds, returning values in both high-level and raw picosecond formats. Use it to track wall-clock time in UTC or local time zones, or to interface with systems requiring precise time measurements.",

It supports both floating-point and integer-based time spans, enabling operations like adding durations, computing differences, and formatting timestamps. Submodules handle picosecond precision and time span manipulations, allowing tasks such as converting microseconds to seconds or calculating elapsed time with high accuracy. Example uses include logging event durations, scheduling with millisecond precision, and parsing timestamps into numeric values.",
