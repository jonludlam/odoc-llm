It handles time as `Ptime.t` values and exposes low-level picosecond resolution through tuple-based representations. Use it to log event timestamps, schedule tasks based on UTC time, or calculate time differences with exact precision.",

It supports precise time span manipulation and rounding or truncation to specified decimal places. Use cases include measuring durations, scheduling events with high precision, and converting between different time representations.",

It facilitates conversions between timestamps and structured date-time formats, handles time zones via offset adjustments, and supports parsing and formatting of RFC 3339 timestamps with customizable strictness. The module also includes utilities for human-readable time representations, ideal for logging, user interfaces, and debugging workflows.",
