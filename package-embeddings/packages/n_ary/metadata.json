It provides operations to compare, hash, and serialize tuples, along with mapping functions to transform individual or all parts. Concrete use cases include grouping related data fields, such as coordinates in 3D space or triplets of related values, with strong typing per position.",

It supports transforming single lists into multiple lists based on element evaluation, combining multiple lists into one with index-aware functions, and handling unequal lengths either by returning a result or raising an exception. Concrete use cases include processing trios of related data, splitting data into three categories, and safely zipping or mapping over three parallel lists.",

It provides direct access to each case as constants, conversion to and from integers, and predicates to check the specific case of a value. Use cases include modeling fixed sets of three states or categories, such as flags, modes, or classifications, with efficient comparison, hashing, and serialization support.",

It provides constructors to create values for each case, predicates to check which case a value belongs to, and accessors to retrieve the contained values, with or without raising exceptions. Functions for mapping over each case individually or all cases uniformly enable transforming values while preserving the structure.",

      "description": "This module family provides a comprehensive toolkit for working with three-element data structures, offering both product and sum types with rich manipulation capabilities. The tuple module handles fixed-size groups of related values with positional typing, supporting operations like mapping and functional updates, while the list module enables safe partitioning, zipping, and unzipping of trios of elements. The enumeration module models three distinct states as named constants with integer backing, and the sum type module allows tagged unions over three different value types, supporting case-based access and transformation. Examples include representing 3D coordinates, classifying data into three categories, modeling state machines with three modes, and safely combining or splitting parallel lists of related values.",
