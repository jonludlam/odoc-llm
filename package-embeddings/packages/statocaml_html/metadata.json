It works with sets of `Plots.Closing.Elt.t` values, offering transformations, comparisons, and sequence conversions to facilitate structured processing of plot-related HTML components. Typical use cases include aggregating plot closing tags, computing overlaps or differences between element sets, and converting hierarchical data structures into ordered sequences for HTML rendering.",

It operates on temporal data structures like `Ptime.t`, profile configurations (`P.t`), and lists of time-stamped events, while also parsing JSON inputs (`Yojson.Safe.t`) to construct plot parameters and graphical objects (`Statocaml_plots.Plot.gp`). Its design targets use cases such as dynamic web reporting, performance trend analysis, and time-based filtering for interactive dashboards.",
