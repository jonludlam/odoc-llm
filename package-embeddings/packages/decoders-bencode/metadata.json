      "description": "This module provides infix operators for composing and chaining bencode decoders, enabling sequential and parallel decoding of structured data. It supports operations like map (`>|=`), bind (`>>=`), and applicative apply (`<*>`), along with let-style operators (`let+`, `and+`) for combining decoder results. These functions are used to decode complex bencode values from input streams by structuring decoders in a declarative and composable way.",

It works with bencode data types such as dictionaries, lists, integers, and strings, enabling structured decoding of nested values. Concrete use cases include parsing BitTorrent metadata files and extracting typed fields from bencoded network messages.",

It provides functions to encode primitive types like strings, integers, floats, and booleans, as well as structured data such as lists, arrays, and key-value objects. Common use cases include serializing metadata for torrent files or network communication in BitTorrent clients.",

      "description": "This module decodes Bencode data into OCaml primitives (integers, strings, booleans) and structured types like lists, arrays, and dictionaries, with support for field-based access and nested structures. It provides combinators and infix operators to chain decoders dynamically, handle errors via custom types, and map results through transformations, enabling precise parsing of complex hierarchies. Designed for applications like BitTorrent file analysis, it excels in scenarios requiring robust extraction of structured binary data from streams or files.",
