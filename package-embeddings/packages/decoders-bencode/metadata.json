      "description": "Performs monadic sequencing and transformation on decoder values, enabling composition of parsing steps and value extraction. Operates on decoder types that track input and output states, supporting chaining and parallel execution of parsing operations. Used to build complex parsers by combining simple decoders, applying functions to parsed values, and aggregating results from multiple parsing steps.",

Works with decoder types that transform values through chained operations. Used to validate and extract specific fields from JSON or similar formats, ensuring correct data mapping during parsing.",

Supports decoder types that track state, transform values, and handle required or optional fields with path resolution. Allows chaining of parsing steps, applying functions to extracted values, and aggregating results from multiple sources. Can validate JSON structures, extract nested fields, and compose reusable parsing logic for data transformation.",

Supports encoding of lists, arrays, and objects with custom key-value pairs, as well as handling optional values and nullable types. Converts user-defined types to strings and directly encodes values into bencode format.",

Supports nested structures, optional fields, and custom type conversions through a fluent, declarative syntax. Used to convert API responses or configuration files into strongly-typed OCaml values for safe processing.",

Supports decoding of nested structures, optional fields, and custom types, while enabling encoding of primitives, collections, and user-defined values into bencode format. Allows chaining of parsing steps to extract and transform data, such as validating JSON schemas or assembling complex object hierarchies. Examples include decoding a bencoded dictionary with optional fields or encoding a custom record type into a compact binary representation.",
