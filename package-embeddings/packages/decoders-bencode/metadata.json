      "description": "This module provides combinators for building bencode decoders in a pipeline style, allowing sequential extraction and transformation of values from bencode structures. It works with bencode data types such as dictionaries and lists, enabling precise decoding of nested fields using paths specified by string keys or lists of keys. Concrete use cases include parsing BitTorrent metadata files and extracting structured data from bencoded network messages.",

It works with input streams and decoder state to extract and combine structured data like integers, strings, lists, and dictionaries from bencoded input. These operators support concise, readable decoder definitions for protocols like BitTorrent metadata parsing.",

      "description": "This module decodes Bencode-encoded data into OCaml values, supporting atomic types like integers and strings, as well as nested structures such as lists and dictionaries. It offers composable decoder primitives that handle error propagation, optional field extraction, and value transformations using monadic and applicative styles. The combinators allow sequential, path-based decoding of nested fields from dictionaries and lists, ideal for parsing BitTorrent metadata or structured network data. Infix operators enable idiomatic chaining of decoding steps, making it straightforward to build complex parsers for hierarchical or conditional data formats.",

It supports primitive types like integers, strings, and booleans, as well as structured data including lists, arrays, and key-value objects. You can serialize custom data structures for network transmission or parse BitTorrent metadata with composable decoding combinators that handle nested structures and error propagation. For example, you can encode a list of integers into a Bencode string or decode a nested dictionary to extract specific fields using path-based combinators.",
