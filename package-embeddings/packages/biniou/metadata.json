      "description": "This output buffer facilitates efficient byte-level data accumulation through dynamic resizing and customizable flushing strategies, supporting operations to append strings, bytes, and characters while managing memory via reallocation or streaming to external outputs. It combines a resizable buffer structure with a hash table to track shared objects, enabling use cases like incremental data serialization or streaming to channels where memory efficiency and deduplication are critical. The buffer\u2019s state can be fully reset, clearing both content and shared object tracking to restore initial conditions.",

It provides functions to hash-cons values, compare interned references for equality, and retrieve the original value.

It operates on byte buffers (`Bi_inbuf.t`/`Bi_outbuf.t`) and structured trees representing Biniou values, supporting operations for primitive types (integers, floats, strings), tagged unions, records, arrays, and shared references. Typical use cases include converting OCaml data to compact binary representations for storage or network transmission, parsing binary Biniou streams, and debugging structured data through human-readable views.",
