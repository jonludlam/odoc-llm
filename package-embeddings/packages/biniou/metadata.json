      "description": "Encodes and decodes binary data using a compact format optimized for performance and backward compatibility. Works with OCaml types, translating them into hashed field and variant names for efficient serialization. Used to generate efficient serializers and deserializers from type definitions, enabling fast data processing in applications requiring high throughput.",

Operates on raw strings and buffers, supporting both in-place encoding and decoding. Efficiently writes and reads integers to/from binary buffers, suitable for network protocols or file formats requiring space-efficient integer serialization.",

      "description": "This module provides serialization and deserialization operations for the Biniou format, handling primitive types like integers, booleans, and strings, as well as complex structures such as trees, arrays, and records. It works with binary buffers (`Bi_outbuf.t`, `Bi_inbuf.t`), hash-based tags, and tree nodes, enabling low-level binary I/O and structured data conversion. Specific use cases include efficient binary data storage, network transmission of OCaml values, and manipulation of tagged tree structures with human-readable debugging utilities.",
