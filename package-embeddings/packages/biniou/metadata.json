It supports reading fixed numbers of bytes, peeking, and character-level access, while maintaining internal state to track position and available data. Concrete use cases include parsing binary file formats, handling network protocols, and streaming data processing where controlled input consumption is critical.",

It utilizes a buffer structure that tracks shared objects for serialization purposes and includes a reset function to clear data and revert the buffer's state, making it suitable for scenarios requiring efficient in-memory data assembly and controlled output, such as network communication or structured data serialization workflows.",

It works with string messages and can be used in any context where an exception is needed to signal failure. A concrete use case is validating input conditions and immediately failing with a custom message when expectations are not met.",

It operates directly on `int` and `uint` types, and interacts with `Bi_outbuf.t` and `Bi_inbuf.t` for buffered I/O operations. Use this module when compact integer representation is needed for binary protocols or storage formats, such as encoding message lengths or numeric fields in a binary file.",

It works with buffers (`Bi_inbuf.t`/`Bi_outbuf.t`) to encode/decode basic types (integers, floats, strings) and tagged constructs, while supporting tree-based representations for hierarchical data. Use cases include converting values to compact binary encodings, parsing nested Biniou structures, and validating unsafe serialization logic through internal safety checks.",
