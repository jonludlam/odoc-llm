      "description": "Performs left-fold accumulation over a list using a stateful step function, and applies a transformation to each element while maintaining a cumulative state. Operates on lists of type 'b list and state values of type 'a. Used to compute running totals or aggregate values while processing list elements sequentially.",

Works with elements of type 'e and a set structure parameterized by 't. Enables efficient merging and filtering of distinct element collections in data processing pipelines.",

Works with maps that have key-type 'k, value-type 'v, and internal representation 't. Used to consolidate configuration settings from multiple sources, prune irrelevant entries from a lookup table, and update values in a persistent data structure.",

      "description": "This module provides operations for manipulating abstract syntax tree (AST) nodes and nested hierarchical structures, including set-based transformations, map traversals (e.g., map_nt, map_int, map_tm), and bit-level manipulations. It supports stateful processing of symbolic expressions, indexed key-value pairs, and constrained type hierarchies, enabling tasks like compiler intermediate representation updates or complex data normalization. Specific use cases include AST rewriting, symbolic computation, and hierarchical data serialization.",

It supports parsing-related tasks such as traversal, debugging, and internal bookkeeping through specialized data manipulations. Use cases include optimizing state transitions and maintaining symbolic relationships during context-free grammar analysis.",
