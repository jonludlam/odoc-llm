Works with lazy, potentially error-prone streams represented as thunks returning nodes. Converts lists into streams, applies functions that may return errors, and accumulates results while handling failures.",

Works with a resource pool type that encapsulates resources and errors. Used to efficiently manage database connections or API clients with controlled concurrency and resource lifecycle.",
