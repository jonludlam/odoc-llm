It works with Lwt-based asynchronous I/O, connection pools, and database query streams. Concrete use cases include managing database connections in Unix or MirageOS environments and composing asynchronous database operations with Lwt.",

It includes operations for connecting to a database via a URI, executing code with a managed connection, and creating connection pools with configurable limits and post-connect hooks. The module works directly with Lwt-based result types, connection modules, and switch constructs, enabling non-blocking, concurrent database access in applications like web servers and background services.",
