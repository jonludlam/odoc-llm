      "description": "This module implements a read-only interface for accessing persistent hash tables stored in files, supporting operations to open, query, and iterate over key-value pairs. It works with a key-value data structure backed by disk storage, where each database instance is tied to a specific file and its corresponding index file. Concrete use cases include efficiently checking the presence of keys, retrieving associated values, and performing bulk traversals over large, disk-resident datasets without loading them entirely into memory.",
