Examples include building a stream of Fibonacci numbers or processing a continuous data feed.",

Key data types include streams and stream operations that ensure infinite evaluation without termination. Examples include generating infinite lists of numbers, transforming data on-the-fly, and combining multiple streams into a single sequence.
