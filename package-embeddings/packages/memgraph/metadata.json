It works with lists of labeled memory cells, using configuration options to customize graph appearance such as node colors and layout direction. Concrete use cases include debugging complex data structures by producing visual graphs that can be rendered with Graphviz tools.",

It works with low-level data types such as `block`, `pblock`, and `addr` to model memory addresses, pointers, and closures. Concrete use cases include analyzing pointer relationships in memory, tracking shared values, and visualizing the internal structure of closures and data blocks.",
