It allows creating explicit representations of values with `repr` and traversing memory graphs with `follow` and `walk`, capturing details like pointers, tags, and closure environments. Concrete use cases include analyzing closure layouts, tracking memory sharing, and debugging value representations in OCaml programs.",
