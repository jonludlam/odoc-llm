      "description": "This module implements floating-point arithmetic and mathematical operations that round results downward, ensuring accurate lower bounds for interval computations. It operates on standard float values and includes functions for arithmetic, exponentiation, trigonometric operations, and constants like \u03c0 and e, specifically designed to address inaccuracies in Intel x87 FPU lower bounds. These operations are critical for applications like branch-and-bound algorithms that require strict lower bounds and cross-architecture consistency, where standard math libraries produce divergent results due to differences in floating-point rounding behavior.",
