Works with Base-32 encoded secrets, integer counters, and configurable hash functions (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512) to produce or validate sequences of numeric codes. Use to build time-limited, channel-specific 2-step verification flows where the server controls token generation and counter synchronization.",

It works with string-based secrets, integer timestamps, and byte-aligned data structures for cryptographic padding and truncation. Concrete use cases include generating TOTP tokens from a shared secret and current time, and decoding base32-encoded secret keys for verification.",

It supports time-based (TOTP) and counter-based (HOTP) tokens using configurable hash algorithms (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512), with customizable parameters such as code length and time window. The core cryptographic module handles HMAC generation, base32 decoding, and time-based counter calculation, enabling secure integration with external storage systems for counter or timestamp synchronization. Example uses include implementing two-factor authentication in mobile apps, password managers, or time-limited verification flows via email.",
