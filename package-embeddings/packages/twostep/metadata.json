Works with Base-32 encoded secrets, numeric code sequences, and counter values to produce time-independent tokens. Use to build server-side 2FA flows where the server controls token generation and verification against a stored counter state.",

It handles string-based secret keys, timestamps, and binary data manipulation, supporting both HOTP and TOTP algorithms. Use it to generate secure OTPs, decode base32-encoded secrets, or validate time-based tokens with configurable drift and padding.",
