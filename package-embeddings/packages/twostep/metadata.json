It produces a 6-digit code by default, with options to adjust to 8 digits and use SHA-1, SHA-256, or SHA-512. It is used in authentication flows where time-synchronized tokens are required, such as securing account logins or API access.",

It produces sequences of numeric codes with customizable length and digit count, and checks against a list of provided codes with optional counter synchronization. Used for secure authentication via trusted channels like email, ensuring tokens expire after a short window to prevent replay attacks.",

Supports 6- or 8-digit codes, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512, and includes utilities for base32 conversion, string padding, and truncation. Enables secure authentication in time-sensitive scenarios like login systems and API access, as well as counter-based token validation over trusted channels. Examples include generating a 6-digit TOTP code for a user's login or verifying a 8-digit HOTP token against a precomputed list.",
