It works with image specifications, data sources, and output streams, supporting operations like retrieving dimensions, loading images with RGB formats, and saving images with custom settings. The module enables metadata management, precise data loading, and flexible image output. Examples include determining image size, loading from a string, and saving in a specified color space.",
