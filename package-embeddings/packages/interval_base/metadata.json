      "description": "This module restores the standard integer and floating-point arithmetic operators and comparison functions that are shadowed when using interval arithmetic. It provides basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root for both integers and floats, along with equality and ordering relations. Use this module to mix regular arithmetic with interval computations without fully closing the interval operator scope.",

It allows setting and retrieving the number of decimal places used when displaying intervals, with support for unlimited precision via `None`.

It operates on a float type to compute lower bounds of real number operations, ensuring results are rounded down according to IEEE floating-point rules. It is used in interval computations where rigorous lower bounds are required, such as in numerical analysis and verified computing.",

It works with the `float` type, treating it as the interval bound type, and ensures results are rounded up to maintain upper bounds in interval computations. Concrete use cases include safely computing upper bounds for \u03c0, Euler's constant, and bounding the results of operations like `hypot` and `dist` in interval arithmetic.",
