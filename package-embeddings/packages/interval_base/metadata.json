It provides constructors like `v` and `singleton`, set-theoretic functions like `hull` and `intersection`, and integrates submodules to control printing precision and restore standard arithmetic for `int` and `float`. Use `I.(...)` to redefine classical operators, adjust output formatting with the precision submodule, or mix in standard math operations to handle counters or indices within interval expressions. Deprecated utilities for size and formatting further support scientific computing and verified numerics workflows.",
