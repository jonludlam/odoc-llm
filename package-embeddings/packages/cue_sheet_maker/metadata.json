      "description": "This module provides operations to construct and manipulate individual track entries within a cuesheet, focusing on metadata (titles, performers, composers), temporal properties (indexes, gaps, durations), and format-specific flags. It works with track records containing time indices represented via `Duration.t`, alongside `CueTrackMode` and `CueTrackFlag` enumerations to define playback behavior and encoding settings. Typical use cases include authoring cuesheets for audio archives, where precise timing adjustments, embedded comments, or structured metadata per track are required.",

It provides functions to construct durations in each format, convert between formats, and perform addition of durations, ensuring consistent output in MSF format. The module is used to accurately represent and manipulate time offsets and track lengths when generating cuesheets for audio files.",

It works with strings, custom types from related modules (like CueTrack and CueFileFormat), and optional parameters to build and export a cue sheet. Concrete use cases include generating cue files for audio CDs, embedding disc metadata, and organizing track listings with associated time offsets and flags.",
