It provides functions to construct durations in specific formats, convert between formats, and perform addition and string representation operations. Use cases include precise time handling for audio track positioning and cuesheet generation in media authoring workflows.",

It works with strings, custom types for file formats, tracks, and key-value pairs for REM fields. Concrete use cases include generating cue sheets for audio CDs with specific track listings and embedding metadata such as genre, composer, or disc ID.",

      "description": "This module supports creation and modification of individual tracks within a cuesheet, enabling manipulation of metadata (title, performer, composer), time indices, pregap/postgap durations, track flags, and REM comments through immutable updates. It operates on track records containing time data expressed as minutes/seconds, fractions, or milliseconds, and integrates with flag and format definitions to control encoding behavior. Typical use cases include generating structured cuesheets for audio CDs or digital media by defining track boundaries, metadata, and format-specific settings while ensuring precise time representation.",

It centers around cuesheet and track data types, with durations expressed in minutes/seconds, frames, or milliemes, and supports operations like track positioning, metadata embedding, and format specification. Users can define tracks with precise timing, set encoding flags like PRE or SCMS, and specify file types such as WAVE or MP3 to generate complete cuesheets for audio CDs or digital media. Example workflows include authoring a cuesheet with multiple tracks, setting pregaps and performer information, or converting time values between representations for accurate media indexing.",
