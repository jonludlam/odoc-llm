It works with user-defined algebraic data types by deriving `to_yojson` and `of_yojson` functions automatically. Use it to easily convert custom types to JSON for storage or transmission, such as encoding configuration data or API payloads.",

It facilitates interactions between these integers and other types like strings, floats, and OCaml's native integers, offering parsing, formatting, and hashing capabilities compatible with hashtables. It is particularly useful in systems programming or interfacing with external formats requiring precise control over integer width and overflow behavior.",

It works with immutable byte-based strings, treating them as indexable sequences for text processing and as raw memory buffers for low-level binary data decoding. Specific use cases include UTF-8/16 validation, integer extraction from byte sequences, hashing, and transforming structured string data through character-level predicates or folds.",

It provides utilities for numeric conversions (to/from `int`, `float`, `int32`, etc.), string parsing/formatting, and hashing, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms. It is suited for applications requiring exact 64-bit precision, such as cryptographic algorithms, binary data serialization, or cross-platform numeric consistency, where the trade-offs of higher memory usage and slower computation are acceptable.",
