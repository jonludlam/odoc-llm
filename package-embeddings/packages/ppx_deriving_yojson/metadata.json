It works with arbitrary OCaml data types, including variant types, records, and tuples. Concrete use cases include automatically deriving `to_yojson` and `of_yojson` functions for types to enable JSON serialization without writing boilerplate code.",

      "description": "This module provides arithmetic, bitwise, and numeric conversion operations for 32-bit signed integers (`int32`), ensuring exact 32-bit behavior across platforms through modulo 2\u00b3\u00b2 arithmetic. It supports use cases requiring precise integer width, such as cross-platform data serialization, cryptographic algorithms, or interfacing with systems expecting fixed-size integers, while offering utilities for string parsing, hash table integration via `Hashtbl.hash`-compatible hashing, and platform-agnostic comparisons. The operations explicitly handle signed versus unsigned interpretations for division, shifts, and conversions, making it suitable for low-level bit manipulation or protocol parsing where size and overflow semantics are critical.",

It supports arrays of arbitrary elements, both one-dimensional and two-dimensional, and facilitates conversions between arrays and lists or sequences, along with in-place operations for efficiency. These functions are suited for tasks like numerical computations, data aggregation, and algorithms requiring precise control over array elements and structure.",

It supports low-level bit manipulation, numeric conversions to/from `int`, `int32`, `float`, and `string`, and hashing for use in data structures like `Hashtbl.Make`. Designed for scenarios requiring exact integer width, such as system-level programming or interfacing with foreign code, it incurs higher memory and performance costs compared to OCaml's native `int` type.",
