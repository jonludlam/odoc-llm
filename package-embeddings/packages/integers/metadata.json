      "description": "This module provides arithmetic, bitwise, and conversion operations for fixed-width unsigned integer types, supporting precise control over low-level numerical computations and bit manipulation. It includes core types like 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit unsigned integers, along with platform-specific types such as `size_t`, `ULong.t`, and `ULLong.t`, enabling overflow-safe arithmetic, bitfield processing, and binary data encoding. Submodules extend functionality with infix operators, hexadecimal conversion, and overflow handling, making it suitable for tasks like network protocol parsing, cryptographic hash computation, and hardware register management. Examples include implementing checksums, encoding binary structures, and managing bitmask flags in system-level code.",

      "description": "This module provides arithmetic and bitwise operations for signed integers of fixed byte sizes, including 8-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, and platform-dependent variants, with precise control over overflow and numeric representation. It defines core operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and bit manipulation through type-specific modules, supporting direct use in low-level system programming, binary protocol parsing, and numerical computations. Submodules extend these capabilities with C-style 32-bit integers, 64-bit arithmetic for cryptographic and financial applications, and standard operator syntax for bit-level manipulation. Examples include implementing network protocols, optimizing numerical code with exact bit-width control, and converting between integer representations for binary data processing.",

Each function directly handles a specific integer type, ensuring correct and consistent output representation. These functions are useful when printing low-level integer values with precise formatting, especially in systems programming or debugging contexts.",
