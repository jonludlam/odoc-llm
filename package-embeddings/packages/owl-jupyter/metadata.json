It operates on numerical matrices (`dsmat`) and vectors, supporting advanced configurations for axes, colors, and output formats. Applications include statistical analysis, scientific data visualization, and displaying probability distributions or sparse data structures.",

It supports precise array slicing and memory layout configurations, enabling efficient numerical processing in Jupyter environments. Use cases include tensor indexing, device-specific memory allocation, and numerical type dispatch in high-performance computing workflows.",
