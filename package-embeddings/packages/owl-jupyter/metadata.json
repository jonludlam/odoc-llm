Exposes types such as matrices, arrays, and tensors along with operations for linear algebra, statistical functions, and numerical computations. Enables tasks like matrix inversion, element-wise operations, and probability distribution sampling. Simplifies integration with Jupyter notebooks by offering direct access to key Owl functionalities.",

It operates on row-based matrices, vectors, and dense matrices (`dsmat`), enabling precise control over axes, legends, and scaling parameters. Use cases include statistical data analysis, numerical simulations, and scientific reporting, where detailed graphical representation of multidimensional datasets is required.",
