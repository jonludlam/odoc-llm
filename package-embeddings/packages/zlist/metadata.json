It provides functions to generate lists from existing data, apply element-wise transformations, filter and slice sequences, and perform aggregations like folding or zipping, with support for strict and lazy processing. These capabilities are particularly useful for handling large or infinite data streams efficiently, such as generating sequences on demand or processing continuous input sources.",
