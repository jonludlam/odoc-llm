      "description": "This module provides parsers and utilities for converting between textual representations and structured data models of firewall rules, focusing on components like IP prefixes, port ranges, protocol specifiers (TCP/UDP/ICMP), and action directives (accept/drop). It operates on character streams to produce typed values such as IP family identifiers, ICMP type codes, and rule metadata, with specialized handling for QubesOS-specific formats including DPI strings and destination port ranges. The parsers enable validating and transforming raw rule strings into manipulable rule structures while preserving semantic details like protocol constraints and address family requirements.",
