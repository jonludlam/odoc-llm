      "description": "This module handles parsing and pretty-printing of network configurations, focusing on elements like IP prefixes, protocols, ports, and CIDR notation, alongside Qubes-specific structures such as rules, destinations, and special targets. It operates on types including `rule`, `dst`, `proto`, and `action`, enabling precise manipulation of network and Qubes-related data. Use cases include parsing firewall rules, formatting IP ranges, and processing protocol-specific configurations in security-sensitive contexts.",

It works with types such as `rule`, `dst`, `proto`, and `action` to manipulate network and security-related data. Users can parse firewall rules, format IP ranges, and process protocol-specific settings. Examples include converting rule strings to structured data, generating human-readable outputs, and validating Qubes network policies.",
