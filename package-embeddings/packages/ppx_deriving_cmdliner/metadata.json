      "description": "This module provides utilities to construct and manipulate OCaml AST elements such as expressions, patterns, types, and attributes, including helpers for literals, tuples, records, and lambda expressions. It operates on Ppxlib's AST representations, supporting both located and unlocated values, with specific applications in metaprogramming tools like PPX rewriters for code generation or AST transformation pipelines. Key use cases involve synthesizing or modifying OCaml syntax trees during compilation, such as generating boilerplate code or embedding domain-specific transformations.",

      "description": "This module processes OCaml abstract syntax trees to automate command-line interface generation and type serialization, deriving argument parsers and type-safe serialization logic from type declarations and attributes. It provides utilities to extract metadata, construct code fragments, and handle errors during PPX rewriting, operating directly on AST nodes like expressions, patterns, and types. The child module extends this by enabling the synthesis and manipulation of AST elements, supporting metaprogramming tasks such as generating boilerplate code or transforming syntax trees during compilation. Together, they allow developers to build custom CLI tools and serialization systems with minimal manual code, leveraging OCaml's type system and AST manipulation capabilities.",
