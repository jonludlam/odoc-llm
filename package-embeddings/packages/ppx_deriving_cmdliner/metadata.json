      "description": "This module offers low-level manipulation of mutable byte sequences, supporting operations like slicing, in-place modification, and binary serialization of integers with configurable endianness. It provides utilities for character encoding transformations (ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16), case conversion, and precise byte-level searches, alongside functions for direct memory access and structured data encoding. These capabilities are used for binary protocol implementation, text encoding validation, and system-level programming requiring fine-grained byte control.",

It supports one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays of arbitrary types, with specialized functions for tasks like matrix creation, mapping with indices, and pairwise array operations. Key use cases include data structure conversions (e.g., lists to arrays), accumulator-driven transformations, and performance-critical scenarios requiring direct array mutation or efficient iteration patterns.",

It supports modular arithmetic, bit shifting, logical negation, and conversions to/from other numeric types (int, float, int32, strings), with explicit handling of overflow and sign extension. It is particularly useful for low-level systems programming, interfacing with C libraries, or scenarios requiring precise control over integer width beyond the standard `int` type.",

It supports conversions to/from native integers, floats, and strings, along with explicit overflow handling and platform-independent formatting. It is designed for applications requiring precise 64-bit calculations, such as cryptographic algorithms, large-scale numerical computations, or systems programming where cross-platform consistency and overflow behavior must be strictly controlled.",
