It supports working with single or paired lists, key-value associations, and sequences, enabling tasks like predicate-based filtering, sorting, and bidirectional conversion between lists and sequences. Use cases include processing large datasets, efficient data restructuring, and interoperability between list and sequence-based data formats.",

It works with mutable byte arrays (type `bytes`) to enable efficient handling of binary data, such as network protocols or file formats, through functions for arithmetic encoding, string-like operations, and range-validated access. Specific use cases include direct memory manipulation, protocol serialization, and performance-critical binary data processing where in-place updates or precise byte-level control are required.",

      "description": "The Int32 module provides arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, division, remainder), bitwise logical operations, and shifts for 32-bit signed integers, along with conversions to and from types like int, float, and string. It supports both signed and unsigned interpretations for division and remainder, enabling precise control over 32-bit integer manipulation. This is particularly useful in scenarios requiring consistent bit-width behavior, such as network protocols, file format parsing, or embedded systems where exact 32-bit arithmetic is critical.",

It handles precise 64-bit arithmetic, making it suitable for applications requiring exact integer width, such as low-level system programming or data format parsing. Specialized behaviors for signed/unsigned interpretations and performance considerations ensure it addresses scenarios where int64's guaranteed 64-bit representation is critical.",

It supports low-level bit manipulation, pointer-sized integer handling, and precise control over integer width, making it suitable for system-level programming or interoperability with C. Use cases include scenarios requiring exact bit-width consistency or when nativeint's larger range is necessary despite its performance trade-offs.",
