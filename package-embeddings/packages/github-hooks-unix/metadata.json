It supports operations like responding with strings, handling authentication challenges, redirects, and file resolution, while allowing low-level control through expert mode callbacks. The server processes incoming connections and routes requests to user-defined callbacks, enabling precise handling of webhook payloads and events.",

It provides operations to create a webhook client, register repositories, specify event types, and handle incoming events asynchronously. Concrete use cases include building CI/CD systems that react to GitHub push or pull request events and automating repository management workflows.",

It supports registering repositories, specifying event types, and defining callbacks to process events like push or pull requests, while offering precise control over HTTP responses and time-based operations. You can build automated workflows that react to GitHub events, manage subscriptions, and handle temporal data for scheduling or timestamping. Example uses include CI/CD pipelines triggered by commits and repository automation tools responding to issues or releases.",
