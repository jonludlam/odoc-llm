It supports request routing through callback functions that process incoming connections, parse request data, and return appropriate responses, including specialized actions like redirects, authentication challenges, and file-based responses. Key data types include connection metadata, HTTP requests and responses, and body streams, with operations tailored for handling webhook payloads and authentication flows.",
