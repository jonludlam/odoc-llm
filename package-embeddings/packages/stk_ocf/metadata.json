It supports basic types like integers, floats, and strings, as well as lists of these types, with configurable separators for list parsing. These conversions are used to build UI elements such as entry fields, checkbuttons, and date pickers that enforce valid input based on the associated conversion.",

      "description": "This module enables the creation of configurable UI components with typed settings and structured layouts, organizing widgets like boxes, frames, and tables into dynamic, hierarchical groups. It centers on `conf_option` values that support runtime configuration, serialization, and callback-driven interactivity. Child modules provide type-safe string-value conversions for GUI elements, allowing the construction of input widgets such as entry fields and checkbuttons that enforce data validity. Examples include building a settings panel with labeled input fields that serialize to disk or creating a dynamic form that updates based on user selections.",
