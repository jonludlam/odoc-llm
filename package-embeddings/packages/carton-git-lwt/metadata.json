It works with byte sequences, strings, bigstrings, and abstract context/data types, enabling secure message authentication and data integrity verification. Specific use cases include protecting network communications, validating data consistency, and integrating with cryptographic protocols requiring raw or hexadecimal HMAC outputs.",
