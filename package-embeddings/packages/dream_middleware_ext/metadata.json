Works with configurations defining request limits and time windows, and a store to track request counts. Used to enforce API rate limits by inspecting incoming requests and returning appropriate responses when limits are exceeded.",

Works with custom types `tb_conf` and `tb_bucket` to track rate-limiting parameters and state. Used to enforce request limits in web middleware, such as restricting API calls to a defined number per second.",

Works with request objects, HTTP method lists, and header tuples to enforce CORS policies. Used to secure API endpoints by restricting origin, methods, and headers in both preflight and non-preflight scenarios.",

Supports types `tb_conf` and `tb_bucket` for managing token bucket parameters, and provides functions to apply limits based on configured thresholds. Can restrict API requests to a set number per second or per window, returning denied responses when limits are exceeded. Examples include limiting user sign-in attempts or controlling API call frequency.",

It operates on configurations that define the filter type and target, using structured data like IP ranges and path patterns. This is used to block access to specific endpoints or IP addresses in a web application.",
