The core type `t` enables representation of JSON data in a type-safe way, with operations for conversion to and from S-expressions, comparison, and hashing. You can use it to parse, manipulate, and serialize structured JSON data in OCaml programs. For example, you can construct a JSON object representing a user profile and serialize it to an S-expression for further processing.",
