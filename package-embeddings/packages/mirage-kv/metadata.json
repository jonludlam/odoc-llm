It works with a type `t` that represents keys as path-like segments, enabling precise navigation and manipulation. Use cases include building and traversing paths in a key-value store, comparing and printing keys, and extracting components like parent or base name for directory-like structures.",

It works with structured keys represented as path segments and supports both read-only and read-write storage interfaces. Concrete use cases include managing hierarchical data in unikernels, handling storage errors during configuration or state persistence, and safely renaming or writing entries in a key-value store.",
