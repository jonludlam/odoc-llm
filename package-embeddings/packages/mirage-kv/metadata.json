It works with string-based keys and values, organized hierarchically, allowing partial reads and structured navigation of stored data. Concrete use cases include serving static assets from a filesystem, querying configuration data, or accessing versioned content via immutable keys.",

It provides core types like `Key.t` for structured keys and operations for atomic reads, writes, renames, and directory traversal, with typed errors for failures like missing keys or type mismatches. Submodules define a read-only interface for querying and listing data, a key construction API for hierarchical navigation, and a read-write interface with support for timestamps and partial content updates. Use cases include managing configuration trees, serving static assets from hierarchical storage, and implementing persistent, versioned state in unikernels.",
