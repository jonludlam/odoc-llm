It supports concrete operations such as variable creation, logical negation, conjunction, disjunction, and equality checks, along with structural inspection and custom-formatted printing. Typical use cases include symbolic model checking, combinatorial problem solving, and formal verification tasks where compact representation of Boolean functions is essential.",

      "description": "This module provides a comprehensive framework for working with binary decision diagrams (BDDs), enabling efficient representation and manipulation of Boolean functions through operations like variable creation, negation, conjunction, disjunction, and quantification. It supports both low-level node manipulation and high-level logical composition, allowing tasks such as symbolic model checking, formal verification, and combinatorial optimization. The core BDD interface includes utilities for structural inspection, equality checks, and custom-formatted output, facilitating both analysis and integration with other systems. Together with its submodules, it offers a unified toolkit for working with Boolean expressions in both abstract and concrete forms.",
