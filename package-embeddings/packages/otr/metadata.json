It works with `session` data structures to manage conversation state, including initiating and terminating sessions, responding to handshake messages, and handling SMP challenges. Concrete operations include starting an OTR session, sending and ending messages, handling incoming data, and managing SMP authentication with zero-knowledge proofs based on user-provided secrets.",
