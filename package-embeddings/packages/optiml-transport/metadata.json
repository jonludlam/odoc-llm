      "description": "Calculates optimal transport plans using the network simplex algorithm, handling cost matrices and transportation plans as input and output. It supports operations such as solving linear assignment problems and computing transport distances. This is used in applications like image registration and resource allocation where efficient flow optimization is required.",

Operates on 64-bit float arrays for vectors and matrices, with explicit memory management required for efficient execution. Handles tasks such as aligning probability distributions or optimizing resource allocation in scenarios where input sizes are fixed across multiple runs.",
