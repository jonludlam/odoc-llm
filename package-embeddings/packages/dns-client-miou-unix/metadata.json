It provides functions to create and manage DNS client state, establish connections, send and receive DNS queries, and handle timeouts and random number generation for DNS operations. Concrete use cases include resolving domain names using UDP or TCP, securely querying DNS servers over TLS, and managing connection state with asynchronous I/O.",

It works with domain names, IP addresses, and DNS resource records, providing functions to resolve hostnames to IPv4/IPv6 addresses, query specific resource record types, and retrieve raw DNS replies. Concrete use cases include asynchronous DNS lookups over UDP or TCP, secure DNS queries via TLS, and managing DNS client state with customizable timeouts and caching.",
