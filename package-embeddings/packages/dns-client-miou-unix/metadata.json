It provides functions to create and manage DNS client state, establish connections, send and receive DNS queries, and manage I/O operations with support for timeouts and random number generation. Concrete use cases include resolving domain names using configured nameservers, handling DNS over TLS securely, and managing asynchronous DNS requests with precise timing control.",

      "description": "This module implements a DNS client for Unix systems using the Miou networking library, enabling queries for A, AAAA, and arbitrary resource records with support for EDNS and configurable timeouts. It works with domain names, IP addresses, and DNS resource record maps, using a custom transport layer that handles both plaintext and TLS connections. The transport submodule manages client state, connection setup, query I/O, and asynchronous operations with timing control. Example uses include secure DNS over TLS resolution, asynchronous DNS lookups with custom nameservers, and handling DNS responses with precise timeout management.",
