Works with grid structures represented as lists of lists, where each inner list corresponds to a row. Used to dynamically adjust the size of a grid during runtime, such as in a text editor that expands rows and columns as content is added.",

It operates on flex-arrays and nested flex-arrays, enabling efficient traversal and transformation through mapping, folding, and indexed operations. Use cases include applications requiring real-time grid adjustments, such as interactive simulations or adaptive data visualization.",
