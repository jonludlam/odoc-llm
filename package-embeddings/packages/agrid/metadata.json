      "description": "This module offers a suite of operations for constructing, modifying, and transforming two-dimensional grids of arbitrary elements, including dimension queries, row/column insertion/removal, and element access with zero-based indexing. It operates on a polymorphic grid structure (`'a Agrid.t`), supporting both index-aware transformations (`map`, `mapi`) and accumulation via folding, while enabling customizable formatted output for visualization. These features are particularly suited for tasks like matrix computations, game board modeling, and structured data processing where grid-based manipulations are essential.",
