It works with Ogg streams, tracks, file descriptors, and specialized data structures like `audio_ba_data` and `video_data` to enable stream demultiplexing and content extraction. Specific use cases include real-time multimedia processing, track-specific decoding, and position-based data retrieval from Ogg files.",
