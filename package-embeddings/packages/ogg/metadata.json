It operates on Ogg logical streams, producing packets that define the structure and timing for multiplexed media streams. Use it to initialize and finalize Ogg Skeleton tracks when interleaving audio, video, or other timed data streams.",

It works with byte streams and Ogg pages, using a custom read function to fill the stream buffer. Concrete use cases include reading Ogg pages from a file or network source, resynchronizing after seeking, and handling stream errors during playback or decoding.",

It operates on the `t` type, which represents an Ogg page as a pair of strings. Use cases include parsing and constructing Ogg bitstreams, verifying page integrity with checksums, and managing packet continuity during decoding or streaming.",

It works with `stream`, `packet`, and `Page.t` types, enabling precise control over packet submission, page generation, and stream termination. Concrete use cases include encoding or decoding Ogg files by submitting packets and extracting pages for output, or parsing incoming pages and extracting packets for decoding.",

It supports key operations such as initializing and finalizing Ogg Skeleton tracks, synchronizing and seeking within bitstreams, parsing and constructing Ogg pages with metadata and checksums, and assembling or disassembling packets for encoding or decoding. Data types include `Page.t` for representing Ogg pages and `stream` and `packet` for handling streaming operations. Examples include generating a `fishead` header for timed media, reading and resynchronizing Ogg pages from a file or network, and verifying page integrity using checksums during playback.",

It operates on low-level Ogg stream data through callback-driven interfaces, supporting custom media type handling and synchronization control. Typical applications include multimedia playback, streaming analysis, or container format processing where precise demuxing and decoder initialization/reset capabilities are required.",
