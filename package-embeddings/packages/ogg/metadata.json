It works with byte streams and Ogg pages, using a custom read function to fill buffers and track position. Concrete use cases include parsing Ogg files page by page, resynchronizing after seeking, and handling streaming input from files or other sources.",

It works with raw Ogg pages represented as string pairs, allowing inspection of page boundaries, continuation flags, and stream positioning. Use cases include decoding Ogg streams, managing packet assembly across pages, and implementing custom Ogg-based formats with precise seek and synchronization logic.",

It handles operations like submitting packets, generating pages with configurable fill thresholds, and inspecting or skipping packets without advancing the stream. Concrete use cases include encoding or decoding Ogg bitstreams, multiplexing multiple streams, and ensuring proper packet ordering during streaming or file output.",

It operates on Ogg logical streams, producing packets that define the structure and timing for multiplexed media streams. It is used to initialize and terminate skeleton logical streams when assembling or processing Ogg files with multiple codecs.",

It operates on raw byte streams, Ogg pages, and logical streams, supporting precise control over granule positions, packet ordering, and stream multiplexing. Use cases include implementing Ogg-based encoders/decoders, handling seekable and streaming media, and constructing or parsing multi-track Ogg files with custom synchronization logic.",

It manages audio and video tracks within Ogg containers, handling format-specific metadata and allowing registration of custom decoders for diverse media types like audio (bigarray/standard) and video. Practical applications include media playback, metadata extraction, and format-agnostic processing of multiplexed audio/video streams.",
