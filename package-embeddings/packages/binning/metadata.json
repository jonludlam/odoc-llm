It supports creating a counter, incrementing counts for specific values, and initializing from a sequence of value-count pairs.

Works with pairs of arbitrary types `'a` and `'b`, storing them in a structure that supports fast insertion and retrieval. Useful for representing and querying many-to-many relationships, such as tagging systems or adjacency lists in graphs.",

It supports operations to create binnings with user-defined binning functions and aggregation combinators, add elements to bins, and retrieve or transform binned data. Concrete use cases include aggregating statistics like counts, sums, or lists of elements per bin, such as tracking word frequencies or grouping data by categories.",
