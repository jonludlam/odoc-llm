It supports operations to add, remove, and query associations, with underlying binning logic to group related entries. Useful for tracking relationships like user-to-group memberships or tag-to-item associations where reverse lookups are needed.",

      "description": "This module provides a generalized histogram structure using hash tables to map values to bins, each accumulating a summary value with custom logic. It supports creating binnings with user-defined aggregation functions, adding elements to bins, and transforming or querying the accumulated data. The first child module extends this by maintaining bidirectional mappings between two types, enabling efficient forward and reverse lookups within grouped data, such as tracking user memberships or tag associations. The second child module specializes in counting occurrences within bins, offering operations to increment counts and initialize from value-count sequences, ideal for frequency tracking or event aggregation.",
