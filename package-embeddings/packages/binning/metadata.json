It handles operations like incrementing counts, building associations between keys and multiple values, and retrieving summaries. Users can initialize structures from sequences, query bin contents, and manage data in a flexible, histogram-like format. Examples include tracking frequency distributions or building adjacency lists for graph processing.",
