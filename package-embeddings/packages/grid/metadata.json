It supports iterative and functional operations like mapping, folding, and neighbor traversal (4- and 8-directional), along with specialized functions for character grid rendering and parsing. These capabilities are suited for applications such as game development, grid-based simulations, and text processing where structured spatial data manipulation is required.",
