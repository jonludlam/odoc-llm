It uses integers and layout settings to determine how many unchanged lines to show and whether to render diffs in single or two-column mode. Operations include setting thresholds for line visibility and choosing between layout styles, which are serialized to S-expressions. For example, it can limit unchanged line display to 5 lines before collapsing or switch between `Single_column` and `Two_column` layouts in diff tools.",

You can create a line with `Line.create`, transform its color with `Line.set_color`, or map over multiple lines to apply syntax highlighting. Submodules allow deeper inspection and per-field operations, making it possible to build and modify complex line-based output like colored diffs or formatted logs.",
