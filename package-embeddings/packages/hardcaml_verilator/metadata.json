      "description": "This module compiles a Hardcaml circuit to Verilator-generated C++ code, dynamically loads the resulting shared library, and binds simulation functions for cycle-accurate execution. It works with input and output signal interfaces defined by the `I` and `O` modules, using `Signal.t` and `Bits.t` types for waveform manipulation. It is used to simulate large circuits with higher performance than Cyclesim, at the cost of longer initial compilation time, and supports caching of compiled shared objects for reuse.",

It works with integer values to represent thread counts and exposes a command-line parameter for setting thread flags. Concrete use cases include enabling multi-threaded simulation execution by specifying the number of threads during simulation setup.",

It works with the `t` type to represent splitting configurations and provides options to adjust line limits for files and functions, ensuring Verilator handles large designs efficiently. Concrete use cases include optimizing simulation build times and memory usage when working with large circuits by splitting outputs into manageable chunks.",

It provides variants O0 through O3 to control the optimization level applied during Verilator's C++ code generation, along with functions to convert these levels to strings, S-expressions, and command-line flags. These options directly influence the performance and compilation time of generated Verilator-based simulators for digital circuits.",

It works with the `t` type, a variant that chooses the simulation strategy, and integrates with serialization libraries for configuration and command-line flags. Use it to switch simulation backends without modifying core simulation logic, enabling performance tuning based on design size and complexity.",

It serializes and deserializes cache configurations using S-expressions and binary protocols, enabling persistent and thread-aware cache management. Concrete use cases include optimizing repeated simulation setups by reusing precompiled Verilator outputs, reducing elaboration time across multiple runs.",
