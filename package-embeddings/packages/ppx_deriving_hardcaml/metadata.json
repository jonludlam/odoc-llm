It works with arrays of arbitrary type, providing utilities for binary search, sorting, matrix creation, in-place mutations, and conversions to and from lists and sequences. These capabilities suit tasks such as algorithm implementation, data analysis, and scenarios requiring precise control over array state or strict error handling via exceptions.",

      "description": "This module provides efficient string array manipulation with a focus on concatenation and transformation. Its `Array` submodule includes a `concat` function that joins lists of strings with an optional delimiter, enabling easy construction of comma-separated values or formatted output. Beyond string handling, it supports general array operations such as `map`, `filter`, and `fold` with indexed access, in-place mutation, and conversions to and from lists and sequences. It also enables binary search, sorting, and matrix creation, making it suitable for data analysis, algorithm implementation, and stateful computations.",

It operates on algebraic data types and records, deriving combinational logic and register behavior for hardware circuits. Concrete use cases include converting OCaml type definitions into synthesizable hardware representations for FPGA or ASIC design flows.",
