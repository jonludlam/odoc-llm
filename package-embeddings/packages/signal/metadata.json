Use cases include declaratively chaining signal updates and merging multiple signals into computed values.",

      "description": "Reactive signals manage dynamic values that notify observers of changes, enabling the creation of data flows that automatically update in response to dependencies. They support operations for mapping, filtering, and combining signals to build complex reactive behaviors, such as computed values or event-driven updates. Infix operators provide a concise way to chain transformations and merge signals, making it easy to express dynamic logic like `signal1 + signal2` or `signal |> map (~x -> x * 2)`. This system is ideal for building interactive UIs, real-time data visualizations, or event-based workflows where state changes must propagate efficiently.",
