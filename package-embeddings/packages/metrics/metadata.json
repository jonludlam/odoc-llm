It works with ordered key-value structures, particularly those utilizing `Src.t` as the key type, enabling efficient sequence-based manipulations and conversions between maps and lists or sequences. Use cases include dynamic data aggregation, configuration management, and processing ordered datasets where key-based filtering or sequential transformations are required.",
