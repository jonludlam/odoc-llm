      "description": "This module implements an ordered map structure for managing key-value pairs with `Metrics.Src.t` keys, supporting operations like merging, filtering, and ordered traversal to facilitate dynamic metric aggregation and source tracking. It enables efficient manipulation of tagged time-series data through transformations, comparisons, and conversions to sequences or lists, while maintaining key ordering. Designed for production environments, it optimizes low-overhead monitoring workflows by minimizing costs for inactive metric sources and enabling flexible integration with custom reporters for time-series analysis.",
