Operates with types `t` representing a device handle, `error` and `write_error` for I/O failure details, and `Cstruct.t list` for data buffers. Used to manage low-level disk I/O, handle read/write failures, and ensure proper resource cleanup.",

Operates on raw byte sequences and sector-sized blocks, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. Designed for secure storage in constrained environments where data must be both encrypted and authenticated.",

Handles I/O failures through distinct error types and provides structured data access via device handles. Supports efficient data transfer by processing data in chunks and ensures proper resource management. Examples include reading from or writing to a block device, handling specific error conditions, and cleaning up device resources.",
