It centers on the `Bap_c_abi.Arg.t` monad, which supports operations like `bind`, `map`, and `choose`, and integrates with structured data types such as `semantics`, `arena`, and `ctype` to control register allocation, stack alignment, and type handling. Child modules extend this foundation with utilities for tuple and list manipulation, exception handling, and higher-order function composition, enabling precise strategies like hybrid register-stack argument placement, conditional routing based on type predicates, and backtracking when constraints fail. For example, users can define rules that insert floating-point arguments into SIMD registers or fall back to stack-passing when registers are exhausted, all while maintaining the ability to reject and retry alternative layouts.",
