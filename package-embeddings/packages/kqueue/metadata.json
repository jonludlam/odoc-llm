      "description": "This module provides direct access to individual event descriptors within a kqueue event list, allowing precise manipulation of event fields such as identifier, filter, flags, and user data. It operates on the `t` type representing a kqueue event structure, enabling configuration and inspection of event parameters for I/O monitoring and system-level event handling. Concrete use cases include setting up file descriptor monitoring with specific filters and flags, retrieving triggered event details after a kqueue wait, and associating user-defined data with events for callback dispatching.",

It works with `Unix.file_descr` and `int` types, enabling low-level event registration and handling with kqueue-based systems. Concrete use cases include preparing file descriptors for `kevent` registration or recovering file descriptors from event notifications.",

It provides direct mappings to kevent filter flags like EVFILT_READ, EVFILT_WRITE, and NOTE_EXIT, enabling precise monitoring of system events. Concrete use cases include implementing network servers that react to socket activity, tracking child process lifecycle events, and handling asynchronous file I/O notifications.",

It provides predefined filter values for monitoring file descriptors, timers, vnode events, and process status changes. These filters are used directly with kqueue system calls to track specific types of I/O or system events.",

It supports creating, modifying, and querying event lists, while its child module enables fine-grained access to individual event properties like file descriptors, filters, and user data. You can use it to monitor socket readiness, handle process signals, or track file changes efficiently in system-level applications. The combined interface simplifies building and processing event-driven workflows, such as dispatching I/O callbacks or managing asynchronous system notifications.",

It supports operations like combining flags with `+`, checking intersections with `intersect`, and provides specific flags such as `enable`, `disable`, `delete`, and `oneshot` for controlling event registration and behavior. These flags are essential for setting up and managing event notifications on BSD-based systems, including handling conditions like `eof` and `error`.",

It provides `never` for indefinite waits, `immediate` for non-blocking polls, and `of_ns` to specify a timeout duration in nanoseconds. It is used to control event loop behavior when waiting for kernel events.",

It works directly with file descriptors, event lists, and system-specific flags and filters to monitor I/O, signals, and process state changes, with support for converting between file descriptors and integers, specifying event types and filters, and configuring event behavior with bitwise flags. You can use it to build high-performance network servers, real-time file monitoring systems, or asynchronous event-driven applications on BSD-based systems by registering events like socket readiness, process exits, or file modifications and processing them efficiently in a custom event loop.",
