      "description": "This module defines a formal interface for translation systems, requiring implementations to provide `translate` and `validate` operations that work with abstract syntax trees and target language representations. It coordinates with its child module, which builds and manipulates ASTs for a custom language, supporting literals, objects, arrays, and structured data types like lists and key-value pairs. Together, they enable tasks such as translating JSON-like structures to target code, validating parsed expressions, and generating output from intermediate representations. Specific capabilities include constructing AST nodes with location tracking, converting structured data to target formats, and ensuring translation consistency across backends.",
