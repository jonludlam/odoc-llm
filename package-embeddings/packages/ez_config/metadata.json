It operates on hierarchical configuration files and sections using a polymorphic type to encapsulate values, allowing delayed evaluation and volatile state handling. Common applications include building OCaml applications with persistent settings, generating command-line interfaces from configuration metadata, and dynamically updating settings during interactive sessions or external events.",

It allows creating, modifying, and persisting structured configurations composed of scalars, lists, and nested sections, while enforcing type guarantees and providing rich metadata such as help strings and validation rules. The core operations `!!` and `=:=` enable direct access and mutation of configuration values, making it suitable for runtime adjustments like toggling features or changing log levels. Submodules extend this functionality to support advanced use cases such as command-line interface generation and dynamic configuration reloading.",
