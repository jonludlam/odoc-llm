      "description": "This module logs structured debug information using the `printbox` package, supporting operations to open and close log entries, log values in various formats (S-expressions, strings, formatted values), and control log nesting and output behavior. It works with log entries identified by unique IDs, log levels, and source positions, and uses `PrintBox.t` for structured pretty-printing. Concrete use cases include conditional logging of nested debug traces, capturing and rewinding log snapshots, and limiting log depth or child entries to manage output verbosity.",

It provides functions to refresh output channels, reset to snapshots, and write to specific channels like debug and table of contents. Concrete use cases include directing debug logs to files, managing log verbosity, and organizing log output with timestamps and prefixes.",

      "description": "This module configures a flexible debugging logging system that generates time-stamped logs, formats output in HTML, Markdown, or text, and prunes logs dynamically by size or time. It supports debug channels, log levels, source positions, and structured output through the `printbox` library, enabling flame graph rendering, diff highlighting, and table-of-contents generation in multi-threaded contexts. Submodules handle structured log entry management, file-based logging with crash resilience, S-expression-based logging, runtime configuration of log channels and parameters, and integration with `ppx_minidebug` for tracing program execution with context-aware log entries. Use cases include conditional tracing of nested operations, capturing log snapshots, profiling performance, and producing diagnostic reports with rich formatting and structured value inspection.",

Common use cases include compile-time debugging, tracking complex AST manipulations, and controlling log verbosity through dynamic level settings.",
