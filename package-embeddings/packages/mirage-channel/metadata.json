Reads return a buffer with available data or end-of-file, while writes send data or report closure. Works with Cstruct.t buffers, flow handles, and custom error types to manage network communication.",

Works with byte sequences and abstracts over underlying flow implementations. Used to manage data transmission in networked applications with controlled buffer sizes.",

Operates on flow objects and uses Cstruct.t for data buffers, with error handling for read and write operations. Supports asynchronous I/O with Lwt, enabling blocking reads and flushes for network or file-based flows.",
