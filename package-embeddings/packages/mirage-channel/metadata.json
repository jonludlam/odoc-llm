      "description": "This module implements buffered byte-streams layered over unbuffered flows, enabling efficient and structured I/O operations such as line-based reading, exact byte counts, and buffered writes. It works with types like `t` for channels, `flow` for underlying connections, and `Cstruct.t` for memory buffers, supporting operations including `read_line`, `read_exactly`, and `write_buffer`. Concrete use cases include handling network protocols like HTTP over TCP where message framing and buffering are required, such as reading headers line-by-line or transmitting binary payloads in fixed chunks.",

      "description": "This module implements buffered byte-stream channels over an underlying flow, providing functions to read and write characters, strings, and Cstruct buffers with support for line-based operations and precise byte counts. It handles flows from the parameter module F, managing input and output buffers to reduce direct interaction with the unbuffered flow. Concrete use cases include reading lines from a TCP connection, sending structured data over a network stream, and buffering output for efficient flushing to the underlying flow.",

      "description": "This module defines an abstract interface for buffered byte-stream communication over unbuffered flows, such as TCP connections, with core operations for reading, writing, and buffer management. It introduces key types like `t` for channels, `flow` for underlying connections, and `Cstruct.t` for buffer manipulation, supporting precise I/O operations including `read_line`, `read_exactly`, and `write_buffer`. Submodules implement concrete buffering strategies, enabling structured data transmission such as parsing HTTP headers line-by-line or sending binary payloads in fixed sizes. Use cases include efficient network protocol handling, where reliable framing and reduced interaction with low-level flows improve performance and correctness.",
