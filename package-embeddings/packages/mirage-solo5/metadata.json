It works with the `stat` type, which captures metrics like live, free, and total heap words. Use cases include monitoring memory allocation in real-time or triggering memory trimming to release unused heap space.",

It works with optional boolean flags to indicate supported shutdown modes and returns a resolved promise with either `Poweroff` or `Reboot` when a request is received. It is used in unikernel applications to handle graceful termination or restart triggered by external management tools.",

It represents the possible return values from Solo5 system call operations, such as success, retry, invalid argument, and unspecified error. This type is used to handle and propagate low-level operation outcomes in unikernel environments.",

It provides `wait_for_work_on_handle` to pause execution until work is available on a file descriptor, and `run` to start the Lwt event loop. It is used to implement event-driven networking or I/O in minimal OS environments.",

      "description": "This module provides low-level primitives for memory management, asynchronous event handling, and system control in a Solo5-based unikernel environment. It includes data types like `stat` for memory metrics, `solo5_result` for system call outcomes, and operations for awaiting shutdown signals, running event loops, and waiting for I/O events on file descriptors. You can monitor and trim heap memory, handle graceful reboots or power-offs, and manage asynchronous I/O with Lwt. Examples include triggering memory cleanup based on live word counts or shutting down a unikernel in response to an external signal.",
