It offers shutdown/reboot operations, Lwt-based task synchronization, heap statistics collection, and enum value translation. Users can gracefully terminate processes, synchronize background work, track memory usage, and interpret system call results. It enables precise control over unikernel behavior through structured data and asynchronous operations.",
