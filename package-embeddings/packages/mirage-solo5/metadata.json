It includes value constructors for success (`SOLO5_R_OK`), retry (`SOLO5_R_AGAIN`), invalid argument (`SOLO5_R_EINVAL`), and unspecified errors (`SOLO5_R_EUNSPEC`). This type is used to handle and propagate return statuses from low-level Solo5 bindings in an OCaml-safe manner.",

It operates on Lwt threads, 64-bit timeouts, memory metric records, and directly maps C-level Solo5 results to OCaml variants. Concrete use cases include responding to virtualized shutdown signals, managing timed event loops, optimizing memory usage, and safely handling Solo5 system call outcomes in unikernel applications.",
