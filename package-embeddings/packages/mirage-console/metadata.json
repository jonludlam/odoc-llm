It works with types such as `t` for console handles, `error` and `write_error` for error handling, and `Cstruct.t` for buffer management. Concrete use cases include handling user input in virtualized applications, logging diagnostic output, and managing bidirectional communication channels in networked or device-emulation contexts.",

      "description": "This module provides a console interface for MirageOS, enabling bidirectional communication through abstract types representing console devices and output streams. It supports operations like `read`, `write`, `writev`, and `close`, along with logging functionality for diagnostic output. Error handling is managed through dedicated error types, and data is transferred using `Cstruct.t` buffers. Use cases include logging messages from unikernels, handling user input in virtualized environments, and directing output to serial ports or virtual terminals.",
