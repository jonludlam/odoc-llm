It works with size descriptions of type `'a Bin.Size.size_of` and supports concrete use cases like calculating the buffer space required for a value before encoding or ensuring a buffer is large enough to hold a decoded value. The module is used to project or inject values into fixed-size memory regions like network packets or binary file formats.",

      "description": "This module provides precise control over binary data serialization and deserialization in memory buffers such as `bytes` or `Bstr.t`, supporting C-like data types with explicit endianness, null-terminated strings, and fixed or variable-length arrays. It enables structured manipulation of binary data through combinators for records, variants, and composed types, while also offering size estimation tools to precompute buffer requirements. The child module enhances this functionality by allowing size calculations based on encodings or values, ensuring buffers are correctly sized before projection or injection. Examples include parsing network packets, interacting with memory-mapped hardware like video framebuffers, or encoding/decoding binary file formats with strict layout constraints.",
