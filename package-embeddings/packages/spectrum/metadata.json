It operates on `StrMap.t` (maps from strings to arbitrary values) and sequences of key-value pairs, enabling use cases such as bidirectional conversion between maps and sequences, bulk updates from iterable collections, and ordered traversal of bindings. Applications include managing hierarchical data configurations, processing environment variables, or aggregating key-value streams with dynamic schema.",
