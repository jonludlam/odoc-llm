Works with OCaml AST expressions and type attributes to generate code that reconstructs records from serialized data.

It supports tagged and adjacently tagged variants with customizable field names, enabling automatic parsing of structured data like JSON or binary formats. The record submodule processes label declarations and applies attribute-driven transformations to generate code that reconstructs records from serialized input. Together, they allow deriving deserializers for types annotated with `@@deriving`, streamlining data conversion in data exchange protocols.",

It works directly with Parsetree types like `core_type`, `constructor_declaration`, and `label_declaration`, producing `expression` and `structure_item` outputs. It is used to automatically derive serialization functions for types based on their structure and associated attributes.",

It generates functions to convert records, variants, and primitives to and from formats like JSON, supporting tagged and adjacent tagging strategies. Key data types include Parsetree elements such as `core_type`, `constructor_declaration`, and `label_declaration`, which are transformed into corresponding serialization logic and configuration. Examples include deriving a deserializer that maps JSON objects to OCaml records or serializing a variant type with custom field names and casing conventions.",
