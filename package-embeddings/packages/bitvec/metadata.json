It works with bitvector values and integer types, ensuring all computations wrap around the modulus. It is particularly useful in cryptographic algorithms, embedded systems, or scenarios requiring precise control over overflow behavior and bit-level manipulations under modular constraints.",

      "description": "This module provides arithmetic and bitwise operations on 8-bit vectors represented as integers, including modular addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, logical operations (AND/OR/XOR), shifts, and bit-level access/modification. It works directly with 8-bit `Bitvec.t` values under a fixed modulus `m`, leveraging OCaml's native integer arithmetic for efficiency instead of arbitrary-precision libraries. Specific use cases include low-level system programming, cryptographic algorithms requiring 8-bit precision, and compiler or interpreter development for instruction sets operating on byte-sized data.",

It operates on `Bitvec.t` values while optimizing performance by leveraging OCaml's native integer representation for results that fit within 64 bits, avoiding arbitrary precision arithmetic. Such operations are particularly useful in low-level system programming, binary analysis, or cryptographic implementations where precise 64-bit manipulations and overflow-controlled computations are required.",

It operates on 16-bit values represented as OCaml integers or `Bitvec.t` types, leveraging native integer handling for efficiency without relying on arbitrary precision arithmetic. These operations are particularly useful in low-level systems programming, hardware modeling, or cryptographic algorithms where fixed-width bitvector computations are required.",
