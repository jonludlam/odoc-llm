      "description": "This module offers cryptographic operations including hash generation and HMAC authentication for byte sequences, strings, and bigstrings, supporting both direct and incremental processing. It handles structured data through abstract types for context management and provides utilities for converting HMAC outputs to hexadecimal or raw byte formats, enabling secure message authentication and integrity verification. Use cases include secure communication protocols and data validation where cryptographic strength is critical.",
