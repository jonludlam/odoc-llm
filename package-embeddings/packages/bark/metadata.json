      "description": "This module provides standard immutable set operations for strings, including union, intersection, and difference, along with ordered traversal, sequence-based construction, and safe querying via optional return types. It works with sets, lists, and sequences of strings, supporting use cases that require ordered iteration, bulk transformations, and exception-safe element access. Key applications include processing lexically ordered string collections and converting between sets and sequences for pipeline operations.",

      "description": "This module defines parser combinators for building complex parsers from simpler components. It provides monadic and applicative operations to sequence and transform parser results, working directly with the parser type `('c, 'x, 'a) Bark.parser`. These combinators are used to parse structured input, such as configuration files or domain-specific languages, by composing parsers for individual elements into larger grammars.",

      "description": "This module combines parser construction with string set utilities to build structured input processors that handle context-sensitive grammars and lexical analysis. It provides a core parser type parameterized by context, token, and result types, along with combinators for sequencing, transforming, and error-handling in monadic and applicative styles, while the set module supports ordered string collection manipulation for symbol tables, token classification, and pipeline transformations. You can define indentation-aware parsers for domain-specific languages, process configuration formats with custom syntax, or implement lexers that track input positions and manage whitespace. The combined interface enables both high-level grammar composition and low-level token stream manipulation with precise control over parsing state and error propagation.",
