It works with ordered set structures, enabling safe access, predicate-based searches, and conversions between sets and lists. Use cases include handling unique identifiers, processing text data, or managing configuration parameters where efficient membership checks and iterative processing are required.",

It supports ordered set manipulations like union, intersection, and transformation, alongside parser types that track context and enable complex token processing. Users can efficiently handle unique string data and parse nested expression structures. Examples include validating configuration files and processing formatted text with custom syntax rules.",
