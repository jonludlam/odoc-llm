      "description": "This module implements an immutable set structure for strings, supporting union, intersection, difference, element insertion/removal, and queries like cardinality or extrema. The sets are lexicographically ordered and represented by the type `t`, ensuring efficient operations while preserving order. It also enables conversion between sets and sequences for ordered traversal, incremental updates, or construction from sequential data, with functions for filtering, mapping, and comparing sets. These features are particularly useful for lex order-dependent processing, such as maintaining sorted string collections or handling functional transformations on immutable datasets.",

It provides operators to sequence parsers, combine their results, and map functions over parsed values, all while maintaining parser state and error handling. These combinators are used to construct complex parsers for structured input, such as configuration files or domain-specific languages.",

      "description": "This module provides parser combinators for constructing recursive descent parsers that process character and token streams with context-aware error handling, supporting operations like sequencing, mapping, and structured data extraction. It works with generic parser types parameterized over tokens and context, enabling tasks like indentation-sensitive parsing, nested comment handling, and source position tracking. These tools are particularly suited for building domain-specific languages, configuration file parsers, and applications requiring robust error recovery and precise manipulation of hierarchical or layout-driven textual data.",
