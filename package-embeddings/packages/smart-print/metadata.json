Its submodules enable inspection of document layouts before and after rendering, using functions like `pp_document` and `pp_document_after_rendering`, while also providing utilities to pretty-print primitive and structured OCaml values for debugging or code generation. You can generate readable code, visualize document structure, or format nested data such as lists and tuples with customizable indentation and line breaks.",
