Operates on socket addresses, connection states, and timeout configurations. Used to establish reliable network connections in environments with mixed IPv4/IPv6 support, such as client applications needing robust DNS resolution and fallback logic.",

Operates with types like `t` for state management, `getaddrinfo` for DNS resolution, and `Ipaddr.t` for IP addresses. Enables connection attempts with customizable delays and timeouts, useful for resilient network client implementations.",
