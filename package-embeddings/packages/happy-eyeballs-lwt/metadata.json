It works with domain names, IP addresses, and socket file descriptors, providing functions to connect to hosts or pre-resolved IP addresses. Concrete use cases include robust client connection logic for network applications like HTTP clients or peer-to-peer systems, where fast fallback between IP versions is required.",
