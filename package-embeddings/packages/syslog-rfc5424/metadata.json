      "description": "This module implements ordered set operations for managing collections of `Rfc5424.Tag.tydef` values, supporting set algebra (union, intersection, difference), membership checks, and element selection. It enables functional transformations like filtering, mapping, and partitioning over ordered sets, while providing utilities to convert between sets and sequences for ordered iteration or bulk data processing. Typical applications include processing structured log tags or message metadata where ordered set manipulation and sequence-based transformations are required.",

      "description": "This module provides typed log tag operations compatible with Warp10 and flowgger, supporting values like string, bool, float, int64, Uint64.t, and unit. It enables type-safe creation, querying, and addition of tags through existential types, ensuring correct interactions with Logs.Tag.set for structured logging. Its child module enhances this functionality by offering ordered set operations over tag collections, supporting union, intersection, and difference, along with mapping and conversion to sequences. Together, they allow structured log processing with precise type handling and set-based transformations, such as filtering metrics or merging tagged data streams.",

      "description": "This module implements the RFC 5424 syslog protocol, enabling construction, parsing, and manipulation of syslog messages with structured data. It defines core types like `t` for messages and `sd_element` for structured data, supporting operations such as formatting, comparison, and severity conversion. The child module extends logging capabilities with typed log tags compatible with Warp10 and flowgger, offering type-safe tag creation and manipulation using existential types. A second layer adds ordered set operations over tags, enabling complex transformations like union, intersection, and mapping, which facilitate structured log processing and metric filtering.",
