It integrates with Cmdliner for command-line configuration, allowing applications to expose custom and standard metrics through configurable endpoints. The bundled logging module exports log message counts by source and severity to Prometheus, supporting custom formatting and manual counter increments. Use cases include standalone applications that expose runtime metrics like GC activity and process start time, with configurable logging telemetry.",

It supports capturing metric snapshots and serializing them into text-based output suitable for Prometheus scraping, using either a standalone formatter or a Cohttp-compatible handler. Key data types include HTTP request/response handlers and metric snapshots, with operations for formatting and serving metrics. For example, it can be used to implement a Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint in a unikernel or convert metric data into strings for logging or transmission.",
