It supports operations to create and track named threads, attach status and log messages to them, and generate a summary of active threads with their recent logs and statuses. Concrete use cases include debugging concurrent applications by identifying thread origins, tracking background tasks, and inspecting thread-specific diagnostic output without requiring external logging context.",
