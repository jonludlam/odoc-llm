      "description": "This module represents a splayed binary search tree that supports efficient partitioning of elements based on a key. It allows splitting a tree into two parts\u2014one containing elements less than or equal to a given key and the other containing elements greater than it\u2014and merging such trees back together. These operations enable efficient range queries, dynamic set operations, and maintaining ordered collections with fast access and updates.",

It provides operations to split and merge subtrees based on key comparisons, enabling efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup. Concrete use cases include maintaining ordered sets with dynamic partitioning and implementing associative lookups in self-balancing trees.",

It works with parameterized splay trees (`type t`) that associate keys and data, enabling ordered traversal, bisection search, and partitioning via auxiliary modules. Use cases include managing dynamic, sorted datasets requiring efficient lookups and transformations, such as interval-based data aggregation or hierarchical state management.",

It supports efficient dynamic operations like insertion, deletion, and range queries, as well as ordered set operations including partitioning, merging, and bisecting, while maintaining logarithmic amortized time complexity for key-based access. The design enables use cases such as persistent data storage via S-expression serialization, incremental computation over dynamic sequences, and managing hierarchical partitions with merged subtree recombination.",
