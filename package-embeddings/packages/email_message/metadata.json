      "description": "This module provides a versioned, serializable representation of email messages and MIME data, ensuring reliable storage, transmission, and comparison. It defines core types like `t` for email content and MIME types, supporting binary and S-expression serialization, equality checks, and low-level variant handling. Operations include parsing, modifying, and reconstructing emails, as well as encoding and decoding MIME data. For example, an email can be read from a string, altered, and written back in binary form, or MIME types can be validated and compared during message processing.",

      "description": "This module provides a specialized hash table for managing key-value pairs with precise handling of duplicates and structured transformations, supporting operations like creation from lists, grouping by keys, and value mapping. It includes a submodule for binary serialization using Bin_prot, enabling efficient storage and transmission of table data, and another for parsing S-expressions into typed tables using key-specific conversion functions. Together, these features allow constructing, manipulating, and serializing structured data such as email headers or configuration files with strong type guarantees. Example uses include parsing a list of key-value pairs into a table with error reporting, serializing a table to binary for storage, or converting an S-expression into a typed table using predefined key mappings.",

Core data types include `Email.t` for messages, `Headers.t` for header metadata, `Bigstring_shared.t` for binary content, and encoding-aware byte sequences, supporting operations like multipart assembly, MIME decoding, and header normalization. You can build structured emails with attachments, extract or modify message parts, convert between string and bigstring representations, and serialize messages to binary or S-expressions. Submodules enhance this with case-insensitive string handling, efficient set and map operations, line-ending conversion, and versioned serialization for robust email processing workflows.",
