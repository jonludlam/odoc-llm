Operations span from basic literals and patterns to complex constructs like type extensions and module type declarations, supporting metaprogramming, code generation, and compiler extensions.",

It includes submodules for dynamic transformation pipelines, efficient string handling, error style configuration, data structure toolkits, terminal styling, integer parsing, and value transformation systems. You can perform tasks like controlled file I/O with `try_finally`, error-tolerant string matching, colorized compiler diagnostics, safe integer conversion from strings, and applying sequences of transformations to values. Specific examples include managing AST modifications during compilation, formatting two-column output, detecting integer overflows, and customizing error message verbosity.",
