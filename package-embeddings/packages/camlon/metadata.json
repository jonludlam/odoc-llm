It works with a sum type representing individual warnings, each optionally carrying string or structured data, and maintains warning states for error conversion and suppression. Concrete use cases include parsing command-line options to control warnings, checking if a specific warning is active, and printing warning details to a formatter.",

It works with `Lexing.position` for individual cursor positions and `Location.t` records to represent ranges, while supporting custom error formatting through `error_reporter` callbacks. Its functionality is essential for compiler frontends needing precise location-aware error handling, such as OCaml's parsetree processing.",
