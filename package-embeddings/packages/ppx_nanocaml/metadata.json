It introduces core data types like `'a Enum.t` and operations such as `map`, `fold`, `scan`, and `product`, enabling precise control over element-wise processing and aggregation, including numerical stability with Kahan summation. The child module bridges enumerable structures and enumeration types, providing `enum` and `of_enum` for conversion, which facilitates tasks like serializing complex data or optimizing traversal. Examples include generating numeric ranges, computing stream minima with `arg_min`, and handling side-effecting iterations over external data sources.",
