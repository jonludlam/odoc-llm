It supports both strict and lazy evaluation patterns, with utilities for controlled element generation, side-effect handling, and precise numerical summation (e.g., Kahan summation for floats). Typical use cases involve processing infinite or large sequences, building data transformation pipelines, and implementing algorithms requiring custom iteration logic or combinatorial exploration.",
