It works with mutable vectors storing `point` type values, supporting both safe operations (with bounds checks) and low-level unsafe access, alongside in-place sorting, filtering, and stack-based LIFO abstractions. These capabilities are particularly useful for efficiently handling dynamic equivalence class representations in union-find algorithms, such as tracking connected components during graph traversal or incremental clustering.",

It relies on user-defined equivalence relations to determine element equality, making it suitable for scenarios requiring custom grouping or tracking of dynamically connected components. Use cases include optimizing hash table performance in dynamic environments, analyzing collision patterns during union-find operations, or maintaining auxiliary mappings of representative points under specific equivalence criteria.",
