It supports ordered comparisons via `le` and includes specialized costs for two-column formatting with `two_columns_bias` and `two_columns_overflow`. The module is used to enforce layout constraints in typesetting systems, such as preferring leftmost column separators or prioritizing page width over column limits.",
