      "description": "This module offers combinators for constructing and rendering structured documents with precise layout control, including operations for concatenation, alignment, nesting, and conditional formatting. It manipulates document values (`doc`) through primitives like `group`, `flatten`, and list-based builders (`vcat`, `hcat`), alongside predefined elements for punctuation and whitespace. Designed for scenarios like code formatting or document generation, it enables adaptive layouts that optimize spacing and indentation while supporting debug-annotated outputs or string serialization.",

It works with a type `t` representing costs, supporting creation via `text` and `newline`, combination via `combine`, and comparison via `le`. Concrete use cases include calculating layout penalties for line breaks, column alignment, and overflow handling, ensuring optimal formatting based on defined cost metrics.",

It operates on a `doc` type representing abstract formatting documents, combining elements like text fragments, spaces, and punctuation through operations like concatenation, grouping, and nesting. Typical use cases include generating human-readable output for code formatters, configuration files, or any domain where precise, adaptive text layout is required.",

It centers around a `doc` type representing hierarchical documents, with operations for concatenation, alignment, and nesting to build and format complex output, such as source code or debug representations. Child modules extend this with combinators that adapt layout based on context, enabling precise control over rendering within a given width. Example uses include code generation, configuration formatting, and producing readable debug output with proper indentation and line breaks.",
