It supports operations to create a trie node, get or set values at a given path, remove values or subtrees, and check if a node is a leaf. Concrete use cases include managing hierarchical key-value configurations or routing tables where keys are sequences of identifiers.",

It uses a trie structure to store key paths mapped to actions, enabling efficient lookup and modification of key bindings, and provides operations to bind or unbind key sequences, switch modes, and handle timeouts. Concrete use cases include implementing modal interfaces, such as text editor modes or command palettes with nested keybindings.",

It supports spawning concurrent tasks, sending and receiving messages between them, and handling asynchronous events. The primary data structures are threads and channels, used for coordinating and sharing data safely between concurrent executions.",
