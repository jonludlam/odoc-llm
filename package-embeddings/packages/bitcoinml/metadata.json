Developers can build and verify Bitcoin addresses, extract transaction data, validate proof-of-work in block headers, and handle SegWit and legacy formats efficiently. Example workflows include constructing valid transactions with script inputs and outputs, verifying cryptographic signatures, and processing raw blockchain data for wallet or node implementations.",
