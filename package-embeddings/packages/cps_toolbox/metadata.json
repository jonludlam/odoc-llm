      "description": "Implements balanced AVL tree operations for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup. Works with ordered values using a total ordering function, maintaining height-balanced structure for logarithmic time complexity. Useful for maintaining sorted collections with frequent modifications, such as symbol tables or priority queues.",

It provides functions for folding over key-value pairs, transforming values, and converting between maps and lists of entries, keys, or values. Use cases include maintaining sorted associations between identifiers and values, such as symbol tables in compilers or configuration settings with ordered keys.",

      "library": "cps_toolbox",
      "description": "This library provides ordered set operations including construction, membership checks, element modification, set algebra (union/intersection/difference), and transformations via folding/mapping. It manipulates ordered collections of type `'a t` requiring a custom `Order.total` comparator for element ordering, with some functions using continuation-passing style to safely handle optional results and others offering unsafe direct access. These structures are suited for scenarios needing precise element ordering control, such as merging sorted sequences, comparing hierarchical data, or implementing priority queues with dynamic ranking logic.",

It provides total ordering functions for integers and strings, enabling direct comparison of values of these types. These functions are useful in sorting or comparing numeric and string data in a consistent, standardized way.",

It supports safe and concise handling of optional data, such as processing the result of a computation that may fail. Concrete use cases include parsing optional configuration fields, chaining fallible computations, and transforming values conditionally.",

It supports lists of any type, with functions for mapping, folding, zipping, and sorting, as well as utilities for flattening and concatenation. Concrete use cases include processing sequences of values, aggregating results with fold, and sorting or selecting elements based on a total order.",
