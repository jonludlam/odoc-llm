It works directly with block device interfaces and Cstruct buffers, ensuring proper bounds checking and error handling for I/O operations. Use cases include disk partition management, virtual disk layering, and implementing storage abstractions in unikernels.",

      "description": "This module implements block device access with partitioning support based on the Master Boot Record (MBR). It provides operations to connect to a block device, read from and write to specific sectors, retrieve device information, and disconnect cleanly. The module works with `Cstruct.t` buffers for data transfer, `int64` for sector addressing, and `Mbr.Partition.t` to represent partition metadata. It is used to access and manipulate disk partitions directly, such as reading partition tables, performing I/O on specific partitions, or managing storage devices with MBR-based layouts.",

      "description": "This module enables direct access to block devices with MBR-based partitioning by providing functions to connect, read from, and write to specific sectors, along with retrieving device metadata. It operates on `Cstruct.t` buffers for data transfer, uses `int64` for sector addresses, and handles partition metadata via `Mbr.Partition.t`. It is suitable for tasks like inspecting or modifying disk partitions, performing low-level I/O on MBR-partitioned storage, or implementing custom disk management tools.",
