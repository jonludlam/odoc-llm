Works with custom error types, Lwt-based asynchronous workflows, and Cstruct.t lists representing data buffers. Used to manage I/O interactions with block devices, ensuring proper handling of data integrity and error conditions during storage operations.",

Operates on raw block devices and MBR-formatted disks, enabling access to individual partitions as separate devices. Enables disk management tasks such as mounting or inspecting specific partitions without modifying the underlying storage.",

Supports querying device information, disconnecting devices, and handling error types with detailed pretty-printing. Operations include low-level storage access and error reporting for reliable block device management. Examples include reading sectors from a disk, writing data with error tracking, and inspecting device properties.",
