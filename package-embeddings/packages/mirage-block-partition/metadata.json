It works with block devices and Cstruct buffers, tracking partition offsets and enforcing bounds. Use it to safely access specific regions of a block device, such as disk partitions, with error handling for out-of-bounds and I/O failures.",

      "description": "This module provides partitioned access to block devices by managing subpartitions with precise offset tracking and bounds enforcement. It supports operations like connecting to a partition, reading from and writing to specific regions using Cstruct buffers, and handling I/O errors or out-of-bounds accesses. You can use it to safely interact with disk partitions, such as reading a filesystem header or writing data to a specific sector range. For example, it enables accessing the second partition of a disk image while ensuring all reads and writes stay within that partition's boundaries.",

It works with `Cstruct.t` buffers and `int64` sector offsets, returning partition information and device handles on connection. Concrete use cases include accessing and modifying disk partitions on raw block devices, such as reading partition data or writing updates to a specific partition.",

      "description": "This module enables direct interaction with block devices using MBR partition tables, allowing connection to a device, reading and writing sectors, and clean disconnection. It operates on `Cstruct.t` buffers and uses `int64` offsets to address sectors, returning partition metadata and device handles upon connection. You can use it to inspect partition layouts, read data from specific partitions, or update partition content on raw disks. For example, it supports reading a partition's boot sector or modifying its data in place.",
