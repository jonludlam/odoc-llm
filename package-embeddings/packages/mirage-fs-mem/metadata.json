It supports data types like `Cstruct.t` for binary data and `string` paths, along with standard result types for error handling. Concrete use cases include simulating file system behavior in test environments and building lightweight, ephemeral storage layers for applications.",

      "description": "This module provides an in-memory filesystem implementation supporting file and directory operations using string paths and page-aligned buffers (`Cstruct.t`). It includes error types for handling failures in read, write, and file management operations, enabling robust in-memory file simulation. The module supports creating, reading, writing, and traversing files and directories, making it suitable for testing filesystem logic without disk I/O or building transient storage layers. Submodules extend this functionality with additional structures and utilities for managing in-memory file hierarchies and data manipulation.",
