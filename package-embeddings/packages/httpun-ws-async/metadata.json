It supports creating servers that upgrade HTTP requests to WebSockets and handle messages with custom logic, and connecting to WebSocket servers using a host, port, and resource path. Key data types include connection handlers, error handlers, and input handlers, along with Async sockets and WebSocket configurations. You can build a WebSocket server that echoes messages or a client that subscribes to real-time updates from a service.",
