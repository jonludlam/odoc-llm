Supports standard operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and bitwise manipulations, along with GMP-specific functions such as GCD, square root, and pop-count. The module enables precise comparisons and ordering of integers using relational operators and logical negation. It is suitable for applications requiring exact arithmetic, such as cryptographic algorithms or symbolic computation.",

It enables precise handling of large integers, supporting use cases like cryptographic algorithms, numerical analysis, and systems requiring exact arithmetic beyond standard integer limits. The functionality bridges compatibility with Big_int while leveraging Zarith's efficient Z.t implementation for arbitrary-precision computations.",

It works with rational values constructed from arbitrary-precision integers, enabling precise calculations and handling of special cases like infinity and undefined. Use cases include applications requiring exact fractional arithmetic, such as financial computations or symbolic mathematics, where floating-point imprecision is unacceptable.",
