It works directly with the `Z.t` type, enabling precise comparisons regardless of integer size. Concrete use cases include implementing numeric algorithms, validating mathematical properties, and controlling program flow based on exact integer values.",

It operates on `Z.t` values, supporting conversions to/from strings, fixed-size integers, and floating-point types while preserving precision. Designed for applications requiring exact handling of large integers, such as cryptographic algorithms, numerical analysis, or systems interfacing with APIs expecting arbitrary-precision arithmetic.",

It utilizes normalized rational values represented as numerator-denominator pairs of arbitrary-precision integers, with special handling for infinities and undefined values. This enables precise symbolic computations, exact fractional manipulations, and robust numerical processing where floating-point precision is insufficient.",

It includes bitwise manipulations, string conversions in arbitrary bases, and precise comparisons through its child module, enabling exact numeric algorithms, cryptographic operations, and symbolic computations. The abstract integer type `Z.t` integrates operations such as square root, pop-count, and GMP-backed optimizations, while comparison functions allow direct validation of mathematical properties and flow control based on exact integer values. Use cases span cryptographic protocols, mathematical research, and overflow-free computation where exact results are critical.",
