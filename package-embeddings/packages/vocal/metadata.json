It supports operations like `binary_search`, `binary_search_left`, and `binary_search_right` for locating or inserting elements in sorted subarrays, and `binary_sort` for sorting subarrays with reduced comparison counts. The `knuth_shuffle` function randomly permutes the elements of an array in place. These functions are useful for efficient searching, insertion, and sorting in partially sorted or performance-sensitive array processing tasks.",

It provides stack operations like `push`, `pop`, and `top` with amortized O(1) time complexity, along with slicing, mapping, folding, and indexed traversal capabilities. Ideal for scenarios requiring efficient stack implementations with better memory locality than linked lists, handling sequences where elements are frequently appended or truncated while avoiding memory retention of unused elements.",
