It enables functional transformations through mapping, filtering, and folding over nested key-value pairs, facilitating tasks such as configuration parsing and validation. The key module handles TOML-compliant key representation, conversion to and from strings, and comparison operations, ensuring correct key handling within the table structure. Together, they support use cases like converting between TOML and other data formats or building declarative validation pipelines.",
