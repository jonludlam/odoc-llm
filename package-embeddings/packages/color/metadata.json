It supports precise operations such as parsing hex codes, adjusting perceptual attributes like hue and chroma, and calculating contrast ratios, enabling tasks like generating accessible color pairs or creating randomized palettes with controlled visual properties. Child modules offer specialized implementations for specific color spaces, such as Oklab and Oklch for perceptually uniform gradients, RGB and HSL modules for screen-based and CSS-compatible color handling, and variants supporting both integer and floating-point component representations. Together, they facilitate applications in web design, data visualization, and accessibility tools requiring accurate and flexible color transformations.",
