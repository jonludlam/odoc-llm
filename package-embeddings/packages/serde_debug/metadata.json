      "description": "This module implements a serializer for generating debug representations of OCaml values during serialization. It works directly with primitive types like booleans, integers, floats, characters, strings, and unit, as well as structured data such as tuples, records, and variants. Concrete use cases include inspecting the internal structure of complex data types during debugging, tracing serialization steps, and logging detailed representations of serialized values for diagnostics.",

      "description": "The module represents structured debug information with a `dbg` type that supports primitives, tuples, records, and variants, using a monadic `let*` for chaining results and `pp` for pretty-printing. Its `Serializer` submodule handles serialization of OCaml values, supporting primitives and complex types for diagnostics, logging, and tracing. You can inspect complex data structures, log detailed representations of values, or track serialization steps with precise formatting. The combination of direct operations on `dbg` and the serializer enables both dynamic inspection and structured output for debugging workflows.",
