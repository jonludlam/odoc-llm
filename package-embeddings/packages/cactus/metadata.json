      "description": "This module provides a comprehensive toolkit for building and analyzing B-tree implementations with fine-grained control over performance, I/O, and data structure behavior. It includes data types for keys, values, nodes, and statistics, along with operations for binary search, serialization, file I/O, and performance tracking using timers, counters, and density sampling. You can measure function execution time, track node splits and I/O operations, read and write specific byte ranges in files, and enforce key ordering and node integrity. Use it to implement efficient, type-safe B-trees for persistent storage, database indexing, or custom disk-based data structures with detailed runtime diagnostics.",

      "description": "This module implements a B-tree data structure with configurable comparison, supporting insertion, deletion, and lookup operations over key-value pairs. It organizes data in a balanced tree for efficient in-memory access and extends to disk-backed storage through submodules that handle serialization, caching, and transactional updates. Key data types include nodes, leaves, page addresses, pointers, and version metadata, with operations for splitting, merging, and navigating the tree. You can use it to build durable key-value stores with ACID guarantees, manage disk-resident indexes with caching, or simulate I/O failures for resilience testing.",
