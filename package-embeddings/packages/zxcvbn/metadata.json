It returns a numeric score and a list of contributing matches, each describing the type, position, and entropy of the detected pattern. The child module provides detailed match segment analysis, enabling fine-grained inspection of password composition based on specific pattern categories. Use this to enforce strong password policies during user registration or password updates by analyzing both overall strength and individual match contributions.",
