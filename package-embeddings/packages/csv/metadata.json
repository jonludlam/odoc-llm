It supports converting rows to lists or associative lists and allows updating headers dynamically. Use cases include parsing structured CSV data, mapping header-based lookups, and transforming rows for further processing or export.",

It supports operations that rely on a header row, enabling field access by name using `Row.get` when a header is present or set via `set_header`. Use cases include parsing structured CSV files, transforming rows into typed records, or aggregating data from large CSV streams without loading the entire file into memory.",

It works with a list-based representation of CSV data (`Csv.t`) and structured row modules (`Row`, `Rows`) that enable typed access to header-associated fields. Designed for tasks like data pipeline processing, semantic comparison of tabular data, and structured CSV manipulation with configurable delimiters or escaping rules.",
