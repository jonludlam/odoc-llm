It introduces custom syntax for binding and sequencing operations, enhancing readability in complex workflows. Basic operations such as `let%bind` and `let%map` allow for cleaner handling of effectful computations. It is particularly useful for writing concise, chainable code in monadic contexts.",

It defines a custom state type and offers update functions that respond to time-based events and input signals. This enables precise control over user interface behavior, such as triggering actions on press or detecting long presses. Examples include updating a button's visual feedback or initiating actions based on hold duration.",
