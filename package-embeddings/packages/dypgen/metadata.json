      "description": "This module includes functions for transforming parser actions and inherited values, working with lexing positions, and managing parser state during dynamic parsing. It operates on complex data types such as parser pilots, rule lists, hashtables, and position tuples, alongside user-defined types for tokens, semantic values, and parser data. Specific use cases include modifying parsing behavior at runtime, mapping non-terminal constructors, and converting between list and array structures for efficient lookups.",

      "description": "This module enables the construction and manipulation of parsers by working with lexing buffers, parsing states, and grammar rules, while supporting customization of disambiguation strategies and rule application. It provides data structures for representing regular expressions, parsing devices, and input streams, allowing precise control over lexeme inspection, state transitions, and position tracking. The child module extends this functionality by offering operations to transform parser actions, manage dynamic parsing states, and convert between structured representations for efficient processing. Together, they support tasks like building domain-specific language parsers, integrating custom input sources, and implementing runtime modifications to parsing behavior.",
