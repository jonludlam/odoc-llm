It operates on data types such as lists, arrays, hashtables, and parser-specific structures like `dyp_action`, `debug_infos`, and `parsing_device`. Concrete uses include converting lists to arrays, building name-to-constructor maps for non-terminals, and controlling parsing behavior through transformation functions.",

      "description": "This module enables dynamic parser generation and manipulation of lexing buffers, offering operations to define grammars via regular expressions, symbols, and parsing rules while managing parser state and debugging. It operates on data structures such as parsing devices, lexing buffers, and state-tracking components, enabling customizable parsing workflows where grammars can adapt or evolve during execution. Use cases include building interactive parsing environments, adaptive parsers for variable input formats, and scenarios requiring fine-grained control over lexing buffer behavior or incremental parsing state updates.",
