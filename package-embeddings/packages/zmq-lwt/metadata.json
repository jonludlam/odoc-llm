      "description": "Handles message routing in a ZeroMQ network using Lwt for asynchronous communication. It provides functions to send and receive messages to specific endpoints identified by string-based IDs, allowing bidirectional communication with guaranteed delivery. Useful for implementing distributed systems where nodes need to exchange structured data with low latency.",

Works with `Zmq_lwt.Socket.t` instances configured for monitoring, returning deferred values that resolve to `Zmq.Monitor.event` types. This enables asynchronous tracking of connection and disconnection events in networked applications.",

      "description": "This module provides asynchronous send and receive operations for ZeroMQ sockets using Lwt, supporting both string and `Zmq.Msg.t`-based message handling. It works directly with `Zmq_lwt.Socket.t` instances, enabling non-blocking communication patterns such as request-reply and pub-sub in networked applications. Concrete use cases include building event-driven servers that handle multiple clients concurrently or implementing reliable message passing between distributed components over TCP or IPC transports.",

It operates on `Zmq_lwt.Socket.t` objects, supporting operations like sending and receiving messages as strings or `Zmq.Msg.t` values. It is used to develop concurrent, event-driven applications such as real-time messaging systems, distributed task queues, and scalable network servers over TCP or IPC.",
