It works with a specialized socket type configured for monitoring, yielding deferred results containing event details like type, address, and status. Use it to track socket connections, disconnections, and errors in real time during network communication.",

It provides addressable communication by assigning string-based identifiers to connections, enabling message passing between endpoints using `send` and `recv` operations. Useful for implementing distributed systems where messages must be routed to specific peers based on identity.",

      "description": "This module provides Lwt-based asynchronous messaging for ZeroMQ sockets, supporting operations like sending and receiving strings or messages, handling multiple messages, and closing sockets. It enables non-blocking communication patterns such as request-reply and pub-sub, and integrates specialized submodules for socket monitoring and request routing. The monitoring submodule captures events like connections and errors in real time, while the routing submodule enables identity-based message passing over ROUTER sockets. Together, they allow building robust distributed systems with fine-grained control over network communication.",

It supports advanced socket behaviors like request-reply, pub-sub, and identity-based routing through ROUTER sockets, with real-time monitoring of connection and error events. Specific capabilities include sending and receiving messages asynchronously, managing multiple ZeroMQ sockets, and handling complex communication patterns such as distributed request routing and event-driven pub-sub systems. Example use cases include building scalable microservices, real-time messaging backbones, and fault-tolerant distributed applications.",
