It supports operations like chaining parsers with `>>=`, mapping functions over results with `<$>`, combining multiple parsers with applicative operators like `<*>`, and handling errors with custom messages via `<?>`. Concrete use cases include building complex parsers for structured text or binary data by combining simpler parsers, handling optional or alternative input formats, and sequencing parsing steps while managing failure recovery.",

It works with character, string, and Cstruct-based streams, supporting zero-copy consumption, repetition, and recursive parsing patterns. Designed for unbuffered, incremental parsing tasks, it is particularly suited for structured text formats, network protocols, and memory-efficient processing of large inputs through Lwt-based concurrency.",
