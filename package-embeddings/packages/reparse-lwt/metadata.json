It supports operations like `return`, `map`, `bind`, and `both` to manipulate values within the `Reparse_lwt.Stream.t` type. Concrete use cases include parsing asynchronous input incrementally, combining multiple streams of network events, and sequencing stream transformations with error handling.",

      "description": "This module defines infix operators for composing and manipulating parsers that operate on streams, enabling sequential and alternative parsing strategies. It supports operations like chaining parsers with `>>=`, mapping functions over parsed values with `>>|`, combining multiple parsers with applicative-style operators such as `<*>`, and handling failure with custom messages via `<?>`. These functions are used to build complex stream-based parsers by combining simpler ones, for example parsing structured network protocols or token streams where backtracking and error handling are required.",

It works with values wrapped in a `Promise` type, representing deferred computations that may fail. Concrete use cases include composing non-blocking I/O operations, handling exceptions in asynchronous workflows, and sequencing dependent or transformed promises using `bind`, `map`, and `catch`.",

It provides core operations like `return`, `bind`, `map`, and `both` over `Reparse_lwt.Stream.t`, supporting incremental parsing and event stream combination. With `let%bind` and `let%map`, users can sequence asynchronous stream transformations and handle errors in a readable, declarative style. Submodules extend this functionality to more complex stream manipulations and network event handling.",

It enables lexical analysis, structured format parsing, and custom pattern extraction, with infix operators for parser composition, asynchronous promise handling via `Promise`, and Lwt-integrated stream processing using `ppx_let` syntax. Concrete uses include parsing network protocols, transforming event streams, and managing complex input consumption with error handling or bounded loops. Submodules enhance composability through applicative operators, asynchronous chaining, and incremental parsing with Lwt.",

Core data types include parsers that operate on character streams, supporting operations like sequencing, choice, repetition, and conditional parsing, all integrated with Lwt promises for asynchronous composition using `ppx_let`. You can parse structured formats, extract custom patterns from network protocols, or transform event streams with bounded loops and error handling. Examples include building lexers, decoding binary protocols, and streaming data transformations with partial input consumption.",
