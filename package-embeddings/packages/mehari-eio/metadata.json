It handles low-level IO primitives such as buffers, channels, and asynchronous file operations. Useful for implementing network clients, file processing pipelines, and system utilities that require direct control over IO execution.",

It works with IP addresses, HTTP requests/responses, and filesystem paths, supporting secure static file serving, TLS-enabled server execution, and structured logging. Specific applications include building scalable HTTP servers with traffic control, custom request filtering, and directory-aware content delivery.",
