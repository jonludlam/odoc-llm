Provides functions like `read_file`, `write_file`, `connect`, and `serve` for concrete resource management and asynchronous communication. Works with Eio's `Flow.t` and `File.t` to enable direct interaction with system resources without monadic wrappers.",

      "description": "This module builds on Eio to provide HTTP routing with middleware, rate limiting, and virtual hosting, using core types like `route`, `middleware`, and `rate_limiter` to structure request handling with time-based controls. It includes direct-style IO operations for files and networks through functions like `read_file`, `write_file`, `connect`, and `serve`, enabling low-level resource management with Eio's `Flow.t` and `File.t`. The module also handles IP addresses with comparison and formatting utilities, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 for network applications. Together, these features allow building secure, scalable web services with custom HTTP handlers, static file serving, and fine-grained network configuration.",
