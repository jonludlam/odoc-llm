Works with file data, custom block structures, and user-defined processing functions. Ideal for parallel log analysis, bulk data transformation, and large-scale text parsing.",

Processes large datasets efficiently while maintaining input order for array transformations. Supports custom initialization and finalization routines for each thread.
