It works with lists and arrays, applying functions concurrently across elements using a specified number of workers. Concrete use cases include accelerating data processing tasks like batch transformations, parallel filtering, and concurrent I/O operations on collections.",

It supports functions for generating input chunks, processing data in parallel, and consuming results, with coordination between processes. The module provides direct APIs for managing parallel workflows, along with submodules that offer parallelized list and array operations such as map, fold, and iter. Examples include accelerating batch file processing, performing parallel scientific calculations, and concurrently transforming large data sets using distributed workers.",
