      "description": "This module offers capabilities for 3D model processing, including scene import/export, texture mapping, and animation handling, by working with low-level geometric data, material properties, and scene graphs. It manages structured representations of meshes, bones, textures, and lighting, alongside numerical constants for rendering behaviors like blending modes and shading. Specific use cases involve configuring material properties, processing animated models, and converting raw 3D asset data into structured scene representations.",
