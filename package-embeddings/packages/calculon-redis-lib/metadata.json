It provides functions to convert these types to and from JSON strings, using either direct string operations or buffer-based output. Typical use cases include preparing messages for network transmission or persisting them to storage in JSON format.",

It works with Redis protocol messages and streams, using Lwt for asynchronous operations. Concrete use cases include real-time message broadcasting, event-driven architecture communication, and distributed system coordination via Redis channels.",

It includes data types for `privmsg`, `message`, and `send` structures, along with operations for JSON conversion, Redis client interaction, and IRC payload manipulation. You can serialize messages to JSON for storage or transmission, send and receive Redis messages asynchronously, and construct or parse IRC commands for integration with chat systems. Example uses include relaying messages between Redis channels and IRC clients, persisting chat events in JSON format, or implementing event-driven services that react to Redis streams.",
