It operates on DOM event objects and a handler type that encapsulates event processing logic and state transitions. Use cases include building interactive UI components, managing real-time form validation, and implementing drag-and-drop functionality with responsive state updates.",

It uses event objects and handler types to manage interactions, enabling real-time form validation, drag-and-drop interfaces, and interactive UI elements. Operations include attaching handlers, updating state based on events, and triggering dynamic responses. Examples include tracking user input changes, responding to mouse movements, and managing drag operations with custom state transitions.",
