It supports operations to add values (generating keys from their contents), check existence of keys, and retrieve values by key. It is used to store Irmin's immutable data structures such as blobs, trees, and commits, enabling efficient deduplication and integrity verification.",

It supports direct key-value manipulation with atomic compare-and-set semantics, using strings as keys and values. Designed for unit-testing, it allows fine-grained control over database versions and schema changes through explicit initialization and upgrader functions.",
