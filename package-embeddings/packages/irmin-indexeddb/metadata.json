It operates on a custom type `t` representing content hashes, with a fixed byte size for hash outputs. This is used to uniquely identify content in a versioned storage system, ensuring consistent key generation and efficient lookups.",

Offers asynchronous IndexedDB interactions for atomic data manipulation, enabling browser-based storage with consistent branch and content identification. Supports Git or Irmin-format stores by generating unique keys and handling branch references through type-safe operations. Examples include storing versioned content, tracking branch changes, and performing test-driven data operations in a web environment.",
