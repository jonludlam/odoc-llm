It supports operations like membership checks, value retrieval, atomic updates, conditional writes, and key removal, all with Lwt-based asynchronous guarantees. The module is used to manage branch state in a version-controlled store backed by IndexedDB, ensuring consistent updates and watches on branch heads.",

It works with abstract key and value types, allowing storage of arbitrary data such as blobs, trees, and commits. Use it to persist Irmin objects in an IndexedDB backend, where keys are generated deterministically from stored values or explicitly provided in unsafe mode.",

It supports operations like `get`, `set`, atomic `compare_and_set`, and `remove` on string keys and values, along with database and store lifecycle management. Designed for unit-testing, it offers direct control over IndexedDB without the Irmin abstraction layer.",

      "description": "This module implements a backend for versioned data storage using IndexedDB, enabling client-side web applications to manage persistent, version-controlled state with support for both Git and Irmin formats. It provides content-addressable and branch stores with asynchronous operations for adding, retrieving, and atomically updating values, where keys can be derived from content or explicitly assigned. The content store handles serialization of Irmin objects like trees and commits, while the branch store tracks head commit hashes with atomic writes and conditional updates. Low-level access to IndexedDB allows direct manipulation of key-value pairs and store management, supporting use cases such as collaborative, offline-first web applications with versioned persistence.",
