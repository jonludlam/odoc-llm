It works with `LongidentSet.t` and sequences of `Longident.t` values, enabling efficient construction, querying, and iteration over sets of long identifiers. Specific use cases include managing module paths or symbol tables in OCaml projects, where structured identifier handling is critical.",

It supports skipping values of specific kinds, checking if input is exhausted, and extracting field keys. Used for parsing structured binary data, such as protocol buffers or custom binary formats.",

It supports `LongidentSet.t` and sequences of identifiers, facilitating tasks like tracking module paths or symbol tables. Users can build and query sets of long identifiers, filter them based on patterns, or combine them for complex identifier analysis.
