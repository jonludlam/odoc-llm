Works with custom types representing shell syntax elements such as assignments, redirections, arguments, and line numbers.

      "description": "The module provides low-level operations for managing C-compatible data structures and abstract syntax trees (ASTs), including memory management, field access, and traversal of nodes representing shell commands, conditionals, loops, and file operations. It works with C-like structs, AST elements, and pointer-based data, enabling tasks such as parsing shell syntax, inspecting command hierarchies, and handling file descriptors through direct manipulation of structured data. Specific use cases involve interfacing with C code, analyzing parsed command structures, and performing string and pointer operations for program state management.",
