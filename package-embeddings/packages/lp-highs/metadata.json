It includes the `solve` function, which runs the solver with configurable parameters such as time limits, logging, and solution tolerances, and returns the objective value and variable assignments. It operates directly on `Lp.Problem.t` values, enabling end-to-end optimization workflows without requiring manual command-line handling.",
