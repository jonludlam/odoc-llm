It operates on `Lp.Problem.t` structures and returns results including objective values and variable assignments, enabling integration into applications with specific performance and logging needs. The child module handles command-line interaction, executing problems and parsing solver output to produce solution results. Together, they allow both programmatic control and external execution of LP problems with detailed feedback.",
