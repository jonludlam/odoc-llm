Operates on types such as `t` (file system handle), `string` (paths), `int` (offsets and lengths), and `page_aligned_buffer` (data buffers). Supports concrete operations like reading file contents, checking file sizes, creating directories, and listing directory contents.",

Works with types such as `t` for the filesystem handle, `page_aligned_buffer` for data storage, and custom error types for reporting failures. Used to implement low-level filesystem interactions in networked or embedded applications, such as handling file I/O in a MirageOS-based system.",
