It works with keys represented as paths and values as strings, supporting hierarchical access to files and directories. Concrete use cases include serving static assets from a read-only filesystem or exposing configuration data stored in files as key-value pairs.",

It exposes hierarchical access to files and directories through path-based keys, with operations to read, write, list, and manage metadata such as modification times and digests. Specific use cases include serving static assets, managing configuration files, logging data, and handling user uploads in MirageOS unikernels.
