It supports querying a list of versions against string-based or structured constraints, enabling tasks like dependency resolution or compatibility checks. The child module extends this by processing version constraints, handling ranges, and translating between string representations and structured queries. Together, they allow precise version manipulation and querying, such as finding all versions satisfying \">= 1.2.3 < 2.0.0\" or bumping a version's minor component.",
