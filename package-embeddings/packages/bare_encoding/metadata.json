      "description": "The module provides operations for manipulating string-keyed maps with polymorphic values, including adding, removing, updating, and merging entries, along with traversal, filtering, and inspection functions. It enables sequence-based interactions such as generating key-value sequences from a starting point, constructing maps from sequences, and transforming data through iterative processes. These capabilities support use cases like dynamic data aggregation, efficient key-based lookups, and structured data transformation workflows.",

It utilizes a stateful decoder type to track progress through binary or serialized input sources like strings, bytes, or custom objects. Use cases include parsing network protocols, deserializing structured data, and processing variable-length encodings in file formats.",

It handles integers, booleans, floats, strings, and byte blobs, with support for both variable-length and fixed-length encoding. The encoder can target an output stream or buffer, enabling efficient serialization of structured data.",
