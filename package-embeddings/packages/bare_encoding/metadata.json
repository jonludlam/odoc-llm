It supports set-theoretic merging, ordered traversal, and bidirectional conversion with sequences and lists, optimized for handling heterogeneous data structures in serialization contexts. Typical applications include managing dynamic configurations, processing BARE-encoded data with variable-length fields, and functional manipulation of string-indexed collections.",

Each function constructs a pretty-printer for a specific type, such as `int` for 32-bit integers or `option` for optional values. It is used to generate human-readable representations of data structures during debugging or logging.",

It supports structured data parsing through combinators like `optional`, which transforms decoders for base types into handlers for optional values, operating on input sources including strings and bytes. This facilitates efficient deserialization for applications like network protocol implementation, binary file format parsing, or inter-process communication.",

It works with low-level byte manipulation in its submodules for writing and reading binary data, including integers, floats, and byte sequences, while supporting structured types like optional values and maps with string keys. The module enables custom encoders and decoders for binary formats, handling tasks such as parsing network protocols, reading binary files, or transforming heterogeneous data. Additional utilities include pretty-printing for debugging and associative maps for managing dynamic, key-based data during serialization.",
