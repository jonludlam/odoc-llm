      "description": "<think> Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a module description for WMap based on the given summaries. They specified 2-3 sentences, avoiding generic phrases and not repeating the module name. First, I need to identify the main operations. The summaries mention creating, modifying, querying, adding, updating, removing, merging, querying, transforming, iterating, finding, filtering, folding, converting to lists/sequences, and sequence-based operations. So the main operations are manipulation, querying, transformation, and iteration. Next, the data structures. The module works with ordered maps, specifically with keys of a specific type (maybe 'w' as per the third summary) and values of a generic type. Also, there's mention of sequences of key-value pairs. So the primary data structure is ordered maps with key type 'w' and value type 'a', and they interact with sequences. Use cases: The summaries mention merging, filtering, converting to lists, building from sequences, and processing key-value pairs. So use cases could include building maps from sequences, transforming data, and efficient querying. Now, I need to structure this into 2-3 sentences without being generic. Avoid phrases like \"provides functions for\" and don't repeat the module name. Let me check the examples again. First sentence: Main operations. Maybe \"This module offers functions for constructing, modifying, and querying ordered maps, including adding, updating, removing, and merging key-value pairs, as well as transforming and iterating over map contents.\" Second sentence: Data structures and specific operations. \"It works with maps parameterized by a key type 'w' and generic value type 'a', supporting sequence-based construction, predicate filtering, and key-based partitioning.\" Third sentence: Use cases. \"Use cases include efficiently building maps from sequences, performing bulk operations, and converting between map and list representations for data processing tasks.\" Wait, the user said 2-3 sentences. Maybe combine the second and third into one. Let me check the example response they provided. Oh, the example has three sentences. So that's acceptable. But need to ensure not to repeat the module name. The example starts with \"This module...\" but the user said not to repeat the module name. Wait, the user said \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So the module name is WMap, but the description shouldn't mention it again. So the first sentence should start with \"The module provides...\" but the user says not to repeat the module name. Wait, the original instruction says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So the module name is WMap, but the description shouldn't mention it again. So the description should start with something else. Wait, the user's example response starts with \"The module provides...\" but the user's instruction says not to repeat the module name. Wait, maybe the user meant not to repeat the module name in the description. But the example given by the user in the problem statement has \"Module: WMap\" and the description starts with \"The module provides...\" which is allowed. But the user's instruction says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So maybe the module name should not be mentioned again. So perhaps start with \"Functions...\" or \"This set of functions...\" but the user's example starts with \"The module provides...\" which might be acceptable. But the user's instruction says not to repeat the module name. So maybe avoid using \"module\" as well. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the description to not mention the module name again. So instead of \"The module provides...\", start with \"Functions...\" or \"This set of functions...\". But the example given by the user in the problem statement (the one they provided as the answer) starts with \"The module provides...\" but the user's instruction says not to repeat the module name. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I need to follow the instructions. So avoid using the module name. So perhaps start with \"This set of functions...\" or \"The provided functions...\". But the user's example answer starts with \"The module provides...\" which might be conflicting. However, the user's instruction says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So the module name is WMap, and the description should not mention it again. So the first sentence should not mention \"module\" or \"WMap\". So rephrasing: \"Functions for constructing, modifying, and querying ordered maps, including adding, updating, removing, and merging key-value pairs, are provided. These operations work with maps parameterized by a key type 'w' and generic value type 'a', supporting sequence-based construction, predicate filtering, and key-based partitioning.

The user allows 2-3. So that's okay. But need",
