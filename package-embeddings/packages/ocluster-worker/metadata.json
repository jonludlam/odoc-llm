It provides functions to write log entries, stream log chunks starting at a specified offset, and close log resources. The module works with buffered log data and Lwt-based asynchronous conditions for coordination. Use cases include handling log output from cluster workers, streaming logs to clients, and merging asynchronous log input into a unified buffer.",

It processes build configurations, enforces concurrency and disk usage limits, and integrates with submodules for log streaming, process execution, and sandbox configuration. The log submodule buffers and streams log data with Lwt-based concurrency, enabling real-time log aggregation and client streaming. The process submodule runs external commands with typed results, supporting controlled execution and custom success validation for build steps.",
