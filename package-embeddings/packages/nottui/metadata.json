It works with UI elements and layout specifications, enabling event handling for keyboard and mouse interactions alongside dynamic dimension monitoring. This facilitates building responsive interfaces like text editors, menu systems, or interactive widgets that adapt to terminal resizing and user input events.",

It works with reactive UI values (`Lwd.t`) and structures like scrollable regions, boxes (horizontal/vertical/z-box), grids, buttons, and input fields to enable dynamic updates and layered content. Use cases include building scrollable dashboards, form-driven interfaces with file selectors or toggles, and layered UIs with menus or overlays that respond to user input.",
