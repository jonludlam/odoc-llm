      "description": "This module enables the creation and transformation of binary decision diagrams through logical operations (negation, conjunction, implication), quantification, and structural manipulation, working with BDDs (`t`), propositional formulas, and variable assignments. It supports formal verification, symbolic model checking, and combinatorial optimization by offering logical equivalence checks, satisfiability analysis, and model enumeration. Visualization tools, format conversion (DIMACS/DOT), and performance metrics further aid in debugging and integrating BDDs with external analysis workflows.",

      "description": "This module implements maps with BDD variables as keys, supporting key-based manipulation (insertion, deletion, lookup) and structural transformations (merging, filtering, ordered traversal). It works with BDD variables derived from propositional logic representations, enabling use cases like tracking variable assignments in symbolic computation or maintaining ordered mappings for logic synthesis tasks. Operations emphasize key ordering and safe access via optional returns, with utilities for sequence conversion and custom comparison.",
