It introduces custom syntax for binding and sequencing operations, enhancing readability in complex workflows. Basic operations include `let%bind` and `let%return`, which simplify chaining of monadic actions. It is typically used to streamline code that involves effectful or asynchronous computations.",

It supports structured sequencing of computations, making nested operations more readable. Users can chain multiple monadic steps with reduced boilerplate. For example, combining I/O actions or error-prone computations into a single, linear flow.",

Accepts a monad containing a value and a function to transform it, producing a new monad with updated type parameters. Used to chain operations that track state or context across multiple steps, such as parsing with accumulated error and output.",

It supports operations like `let%bind` and `let%return` to manage effectful computations, stateful transformations, and error propagation in a linear, readable format. Examples include chaining I/O operations, parsing with context tracking, or handling asynchronous workflows with structured type parameters. The module enables complex, nested logic to be expressed as a sequence of bindings, improving clarity and maintainability.",
