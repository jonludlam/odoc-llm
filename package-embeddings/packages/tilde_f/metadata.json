      "description": "This module enables syntactic support for chaining computations in the `Tilde_f` monad using `let`-binding syntax, simplifying the sequencing of operations like `bind` and `map` without lambda expressions. It is particularly useful for composing functions that thread an index or state through transformations, such as in parsing or traversal logic. The main data type is `Tilde_f.t`, with operations like `bind` and `map` made more readable through the `let` syntax. Submodules provide additional structure for organizing and extending this functionality.",

      "description": "Let_syntax enhances the composition of stateful computations in the `Tilde_f` monad by providing infix operators and `let`-binding syntax that eliminate nested function calls. It centers around the `Tilde_f.t` type, offering streamlined versions of `bind` and `map` that pass an implicit state through sequential operations. For example, it allows writing a sequence of parsing steps as chained `let%bind` expressions, each receiving the updated state from the previous. Submodules extend this capability with structured ways to manage and transform state across complex workflows.",

      "description": "This module provides monadic composition operators for chaining computations that transform values within a three-argument monadic structure. It supports binding and mapping operations over values of type `('a, 'i, 'j) Tilde_f.t`, enabling sequential computation where each step may depend on the output of the previous. Concrete use cases include structuring complex data transformations with embedded context, such as parsing or validation pipelines where intermediate results influence subsequent steps.",

      "description": "This module enables composing functions with labeled arguments using monadic bind and map operations, tracking argument and result types through the `T` type constructor. It supports direct function adaptation with `of_curried`, `of_unlabeled`, and `of_local`, allowing developers to flatten deeply nested function calls and improve readability in complex code. The Let_syntax submodule introduces infix operators and `let`-binding syntax to simplify stateful computations, letting users chain parsing or transformation steps sequentially. A separate submodule extends this capability to three-argument monadic structures, supporting data transformations that carry context forward through pipelines.",
