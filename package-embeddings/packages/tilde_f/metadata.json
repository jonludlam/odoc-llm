It supports monadic composition over values of type `('a, 'i, 'j) Tilde_f.t`, where transformations and dependencies are sequenced based on their input-output state transitions. Concrete use cases include flattening deeply nested function applications that pass through successive transformations, such as parsing pipelines or multi-step data processing where intermediate results feed into subsequent stages.",
