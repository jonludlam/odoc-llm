It supports composing and error-handling asynchronous computations using monadic bind and catch functions. Concrete use cases include implementing secure network clients and servers with custom I/O pipelines.",

It provides functions to prepare queries, bind parameters, execute statements, and process results through mapping, folding, or iteration, supporting both single and batch operations. Use cases include safely executing dynamic SQL with typed parameters, managing prepared statement lifecycles, and efficiently processing large result sets.",

It works with database handles (`t`), SSL configurations, and PostgreSQL result sets represented as lists of value options. Concrete use cases include building non-blocking database clients with connection pooling, executing parameterized SQL queries with type-safe bindings, and managing transactions with automatic rollback on error.",
