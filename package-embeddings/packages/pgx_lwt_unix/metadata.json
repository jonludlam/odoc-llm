It supports operations like parameterized query execution, result folding, mapping, and iteration, along with portal management for cursor-like handling of result sets. Concrete use cases include efficiently executing repeated queries with varying parameters and streaming large result sets without loading all data into memory.",

It supports operations like binding, connecting, and transferring data over sockets using a custom `ssl_config` type. Concrete use cases include implementing secure network clients and servers with fine-grained control over SSL/TLS settings.",

      "description": "This module implements asynchronous PostgreSQL client operations using Lwt, enabling connections, query execution, transaction control, and prepared statements. It centers around connection handles (`t`), SQL strings, and parameterized values (`Pgx_value.v`), supporting direct query execution with `execute`, bulk operations with `execute_many`, and atomic transactions via `with_transaction`. The first child module enhances prepared statement handling, allowing typed parameter execution and efficient result processing, ideal for repeated queries and streaming large datasets. The second child module provides low-level Lwt-based networking with SSL support, enabling secure socket communication for custom PostgreSQL clients and servers.",
