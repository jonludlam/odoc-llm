      "description": "This module supports conversion and serialization of cryptographic signatures and messages, using raw byte buffers and GADT-based types (`plain`, `recoverable`) to enforce type-level distinctions during operations. It facilitates signing messages, verifying signatures, and public key recovery on the secp256k1 curve, handling secret/public keys and signature variants with optional buffer-based output. These capabilities are critical for blockchain transaction signing, cryptographic authentication, and systems requiring precise byte-level control over elliptic curve operations.",

It includes submodules for key manipulation, handling arithmetic operations and conversions, and for signature and message serialization, enforcing type-level distinctions between signature variants. Context management is also integrated, allowing secure setup and randomization of cryptographic contexts for signing and verification. Use cases include blockchain transaction signing, cryptographic authentication, and key derivation with precise control over low-level operations.",
