Works with custom types `flag` and `t` to represent configuration and context state. Used to enhance security by introducing blinding values during cryptographic operations, particularly in environments sensitive to side-channel attacks.",

Works with secret and public key types, supporting cryptographic transformations and serialization. Reads and writes keys from buffers, combines multiple keys into a single public key, and applies tweaks or neuterization based on context.",

It supports DER encoding, recovery ID extraction, and both standard and recoverable signature operations, with safe and unsafe variants for parsing and writing. Use cases include secure message authentication, signature generation with secret keys, and reconstructing signatures from recoverable data in protocols requiring key recovery.",
