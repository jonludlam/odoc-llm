It handles data structures such as recoverable and non-recoverable signatures, secret and public keys, and provides functionality for serializing signatures in DER or compact formats, as well as converting between byte representations and message types. These capabilities are essential for applications like blockchain transaction signing and verification, where efficient signature handling and interoperability with different serialization formats are required.",

It supports reading and writing keys from and to buffers, including compressed representations, and provides key combination and neuterization for deriving public keys from secrets. Concrete use cases include signing key derivation, public key aggregation, and binary serialization for network transmission or storage.",
