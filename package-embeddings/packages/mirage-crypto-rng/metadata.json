      "description": "Provides functions to manage entropy sources, collect random data from CPU instructions like `rdrand` and `rdseed`, and bootstrap random number generators using hardware-based methods. Works with source identifiers, random data strings, and optional pool managers. Used to initialize secure random number generators in environments where hardware entropy is available or to fall back to CPU-level data race techniques when necessary.",

It processes entropy from external sources via `accumulate` and tracks seeding status with `seeded`. Designed for systems requiring deterministic reseeding and incremental entropy injection.",

It includes utilities for handling cryptographic state management via `ctx` and `t` types, enabling deterministic random bit generation and secure authentication workflows. Specific use cases involve secure key derivation, authenticated encryption, and generating cryptographically strong random numbers.",

It operates on byte buffers and maintains internal state for continuous random data production. Reseeding updates the generator's state directly, and it supports incremental entropy accumulation from external sources.",
