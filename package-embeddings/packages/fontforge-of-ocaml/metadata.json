It operates on glyph sequences and font data using typed tables (`gsub_ligature_t`, `gpos_pair_t`, etc.) to implement script-specific behaviors, vertical text rendering, and historical glyph variants. Key use cases include enabling complex script shaping (e.g., Indic forms), stylistic alternates, small capitals, and language-specific typographic refinements such as Japanese historical forms or vertical kana alternates.",
