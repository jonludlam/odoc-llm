It provides the functions `t_of_string` and `string_of_t` to decode from and encode to Biniou-formatted strings, working directly with the type `t` defined in the parent module. It is used when persisting or transmitting structured data in a compact, efficient binary format.",

It supports typed storage and retrieval of records, using `Record_id.t` to manage unique identifiers, and handles transactional state changes and schema definitions. The module enables use cases like in-memory database setup and structured data persistence, with direct support for inserting, reading, and managing records. Submodules extend these capabilities with specialized operations for record visibility and persistent storage.",

It provides core operations like `string_of_t` and `t_of_string` for transforming values to and from string or binary representations, facilitating data persistence and transmission. The JSON submodule handles structured, human-readable serialization, the Biniou submodule offers compact binary encoding, and the generic submodule supports arbitrary data types with user-provided serializers. Examples include converting a database record to JSON for logging, encoding a configuration value to Biniou for efficient storage, or serializing custom types over a network.",

It manages unique record identifiers through built-in operations and supports structured querying, transactional updates, and schema handling via its core submodule. Serialization capabilities allow conversion of records to JSON for readability or Biniou for compact storage, while record IDs facilitate entity tracking and version comparisons. Use cases include configuration management, audit logging with versioning, and lightweight persistent state handling with selective shadowing.",
