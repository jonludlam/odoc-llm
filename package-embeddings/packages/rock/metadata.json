It supports operations to add, remove, query, iterate over, and fold across key-value bindings, with keys managing type safety and metadata for use cases such as tracking HTTP headers or session identifiers. You can, for example, insert a key-value pair representing a user session, retrieve it elsewhere in the pipeline, and safely ensure its type matches expectations. Submodule Keys handle creation and metadata management, while the main module provides the context-wide operations for binding manipulation and traversal.",
