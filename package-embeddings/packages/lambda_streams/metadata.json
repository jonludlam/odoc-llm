It enables reactive programming patterns for real-time data feeds, UI events, and background task notifications, while its child modules extend functionality with time-based operations. One submodule schedules and cancels recurring tasks using `interval_id`, ideal for periodic polling and animation loops, while another generates timed numeric streams for heartbeats or finite counters. Together, they provide a cohesive toolkit for building responsive, event-driven applications with precise temporal control.",
