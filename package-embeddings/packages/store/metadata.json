These operations are used to manage mutable state in a way that supports snapshots and backtracking, such as during incremental computation or transactional updates.",

It works with a `store` type that holds mutable references, allowing precise control over state changes and backtracking. Concrete use cases include implementing backtracking algorithms, transactional data structures like union-find, and incremental computations where state must be saved and reverted efficiently.",
