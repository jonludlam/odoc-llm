It works with the `Store.store` type and polymorphic reference values parameterized by the store. Concrete use cases include building backtracking algorithms and transactional data structures like union-find, where references track state changes that can be rolled back or restored.",

It provides references tied to the store, allowing creation, assignment, and equality checks, along with transactional commit and rollback operations. You can implement backtracking algorithms, transactional interpreters, or data structures like union-find that support state restoration. Snapshots let you save and revert to prior versions, while transactions offer efficient, one-time rollback capability for temporary state changes.",
