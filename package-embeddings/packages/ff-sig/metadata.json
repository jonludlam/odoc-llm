It works with a field element type `t` and a prime modulus `p` exposed as `order`, supporting conversions to/from bytes, strings, and Zarith representations. Key use cases include cryptographic protocol implementation, random field element generation, and zero-knowledge proof systems requiring efficient finite field operations.",

      "description": "This module type provides arithmetic operations on prime field elements (modular addition, multiplication, inversion) and specialized functions for roots of unity, including exponentiation, quadratic residue checks, and Legendre symbol computation. It works with finite field elements represented as type `t` (integers modulo a prime `order`) and supports operations requiring algebraic properties of roots of unity. These capabilities are particularly useful in cryptographic protocols relying on finite field arithmetic (e.g., zk-SNARKs, STARKs) and error-correcting codes leveraging cyclic structures.",

      "description": "This module defines the foundational algebraic structures for working with finite fields, including prime fields and fields with roots of unity, enabling precise and efficient arithmetic operations required in cryptographic protocols. It introduces core data types for field elements, primes, and modular parameters, supporting operations such as addition, multiplication, inversion, exponentiation, and root-of-unity computations, with direct applications in zero-knowledge proofs and elliptic curve cryptography. Submodules refine these abstractions to specialize in prime field arithmetic, root-based operations, and serialization, offering concrete functionality like byte encoding, Legendre symbol evaluation, and secure division. Together, the module and its submodules provide a comprehensive interface for implementing and optimizing cryptographic systems that rely on structured finite field computations.",
