It takes HTTPS configuration and a request handler that processes incoming requests and returns responses asynchronously. It works with Cohttp and Lwt types for handling HTTP messages and asynchronous operations. A concrete use case is serving ActivityPub API endpoints over HTTPS with proper TLS configuration.",

Core data types include IRIs, RDF graphs, ActivityPub activities, and media objects, with operations for server-side rendering, partial updates, collection management, and asynchronous delivery of federated content. It enables concrete use cases such as rendering paginated activity streams, handling follow requests across servers, storing and serving user media, and managing actor identities with cryptographic keys. The system integrates filesystem and HTTP backends for decentralized data resolution, supports content negotiation and JSON-LD processing, and runs as a secure, configurable TLS server with structured logging and error handling.",
