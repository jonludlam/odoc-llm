It works with buffer types like `Buffer.t` and Bigarray-based structures, providing safe and unsafe variants for controlled memory access. Use cases include network protocol parsing, binary file manipulation, and performance-critical applications requiring direct memory handling.",

Supports buffer types such as `Buffer.t` and Bigarray, with safe and unsafe access options for precise memory control. Enables tasks like network packet parsing, binary file editing, and high-performance data processing. Examples include extracting a 32-bit little-endian integer from a buffer or writing a 16-bit big-endian value to a Bigarray.",
