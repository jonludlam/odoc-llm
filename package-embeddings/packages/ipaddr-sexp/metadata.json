It operates on IPv4 address prefixes represented as CIDR blocks. Use this module when working with network configurations, routing tables, or IP access control lists that require prefix-based operations.",

It operates on `Ipaddr.V6.t` with `sexp_of_t` and `t_of_sexp`, while its child module manages prefixes, supporting validation, subnet checks, and canonicalization. You can persist IPv6 addresses in configuration files or transmit them across network protocols, and work with prefix lengths for routing and network configuration tasks.",

It supports direct conversion of `Ipaddr.V4.t` values to and from s-expressions, enabling seamless use in configuration files and protocol messages. The child module extends this with CIDR prefix operations, allowing prefix parsing, comparison, and network configuration tasks like routing or access control. Together, they enable reading, writing, and manipulating both individual IPv4 addresses and network ranges in a type-safe manner.",

Its functions, such as `sexp_of_t` and `t_of_sexp`, facilitate persisting IP configurations or transmitting structured IP data over networks. Submodules handle IPv4 and IPv6 specifics, including CIDR prefix operations for routing and access control, while the prefix module supports parsing, comparison, and canonicalization of network ranges. Use cases include working with IP address literals in configuration files or encoding network ranges for inter-process communication.",
