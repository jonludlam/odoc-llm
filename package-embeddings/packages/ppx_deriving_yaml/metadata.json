It supports customization through attributes like `key`, `name`, and `default` to control field naming and default values, and includes utilities for transforming OCaml type declarations into YAML conversion functions. It generates serialization logic for types by processing `Ppxlib.core_type` and `Ppxlib.type_declaration` structures, enabling automatic derivation of YAML encoders and decoders for user-defined types. Internally, it uses constants and attribute handlers to manage code generation, allowing precise control over type-to-YAML mappings during PPX processing.",
