It handles mutable and immutable values, preserves sharing, and safely formats cyclic structures by avoiding infinite loops. The output adheres to OCaml syntax, enabling use cases like pretty-printing serialized data, debugging complex values, or generating valid OCaml code snippets with consistent indentation and line breaks.",

It works with document values, ranges, and formatting states to enable tasks like generating OCaml code, pretty-printing nested data structures, and composing human-readable text from atomic elements and delimiters. Key use cases include formatting source code with syntactic validity, rendering complex outputs with conditional layout choices, and building composable document fragments for structured text generation.",

It works with a `document` type that represents formattable text, enabling precise control over spacing and alignment, and supports rendering to channels, buffers, or formatters in either compact or width-constrained \"pretty\" modes. It is particularly useful for code formatting tasks requiring UTF-8 handling, ribbon-aware layout adjustments, and stateful document analysis during rendering.",
