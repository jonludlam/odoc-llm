It supports operations like `return` for embedding values, `fmap` for applying functions to tree nodes, and list-like constructors such as `nil`, `singleton`, `cons`, and `append` for building and combining sequences of trees. Concrete use cases include generating HTML documents with reactive or dynamic elements in web applications.",

It includes data types for SVG-specific constructs such as gradients, filters, and event handlers, allowing precise control over rendering and behavior. The child module handles SVG document metadata, providing constants for namespaces, content types, and version declarations, ensuring correct document structure and validation. Together, they support tasks like building responsive data visualizations, exporting valid SVG files with proper headers, and applying type-safe transformations to vector graphics.",

It provides type-safe utilities for handling DOM events, form controls, media elements, and accessibility attributes, operating on typed values such as strings, URIs, numbers, and booleans. A companion module supplies constants like `doctype`, `namespace`, and `emptytags` for defining document structure and ensuring standards compliance. Together, they support building interactive, real-time web applications with safe, composable HTML generation and robust document scaffolding.",

It provides core data types like `elt` for live nodes and attribute containers, along with operations to build and transform structured XML trees. Submodules extend this capability with list-like combinators such as `cons`, `append`, and `fmap`, allowing the creation of dynamic, reactive HTML content. Examples include rendering interactive forms, building HTML documents from data streams, and managing dynamic UI components in web applications.",
