Its layout controls (indentation, line breaks, spacing) and structural rendering tools (parentheses, brackets, separators) are designed for converting abstract syntax trees into readable code or data representations, particularly in language unparsing tasks.",

It works with `Langs_common.Astloc.t` references and a type `c` representing layered locations, supporting operations like merging, dumping, and analyzing layer hierarchies. Concrete use cases include tracking and combining source code location metadata across different parsing or transformation stages.",

It provides `default_encoding` to specify the default encoding and `encoding_to_string` to convert encoding values to their string representations. It is used to handle source text encoding in parsing or file processing tasks where specific character sets must be identified or converted.",

It works with strings representing file paths and uses a custom hash table type to cache extension lookups. Concrete use cases include normalizing filenames with escaped characters, managing extended filename formats, and efficiently retrieving file extensions for processing.",

It focuses on `body` structures representing code objects or functions, supporting operations to inspect and modify their resolution state and conditional markers. These tools are particularly useful in scenarios requiring dynamic control over macro expansion logic, such as implementing conditional compilation or deferred resolution strategies in parsed languages.",
