It operates on box styles and block layout configurations to organize output, while supporting punctuation, delimiters, and handling of optional or indexed components. It is particularly suited for code generation, pretty-printing abstract syntax trees, or rendering nested data structures with precise typographic control.",

It operates on structured body values to manipulate conditional state flags, enabling dynamic evaluation tracking during macro processing. These capabilities are particularly useful for implementing preprocessors or configuration systems where conditional macro behavior must be explicitly controlled and traced.",

It operates on strings, lexing positions, tokens, qtokens, and AST locations, incorporating optional filename caching and customizable error reporting via output channels. These features are critical for building parsers that require precise source tracking and robust error handling in applications like compilers or interpreters.",

It coordinates with a shared `Format.formatter` to direct output to specific destinations, enabling consistent pretty-printing and logging across components. Low-level layout primitives manage spacing, indentation, and structural symbols, making it suitable for code generation and rendering nested data.
