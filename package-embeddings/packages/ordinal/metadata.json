It works with custom types like `parser`, `interpreter`, `word`, and `value`, alongside arrays and strings, enabling tasks such as value conversion, comparison, and stack manipulation. Use cases include dynamic language interpretation, structured data parsing, and controlled execution of procedural commands.",
