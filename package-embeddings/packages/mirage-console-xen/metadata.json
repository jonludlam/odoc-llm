      "description": "This module implements text console I/O operations for interacting with Xen virtual machine consoles. It provides functions to read from and write to a console connection, disconnect or close the connection gracefully, and log messages with automatic line endings. The primary data types are `t` for console handles, `error` and `write_error` for failure conditions, and operations work with Cstruct buffers and string lists for transmission. Use cases include guest VM console access in cloud environments, remote debugging via serial console, and logging infrastructure for Xen-based virtualization platforms.",
