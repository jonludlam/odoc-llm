Operates on opaque limit representations and raw integer values to apply constraints during process execution. Used to restrict process behavior in sandboxed environments or resource-constrained deployments.",

Operates with integers representing memory sizes in kilobytes and megabytes, and string-based context retrieval. Used to safely run potentially memory-intensive operations in environments with strict resource controls.",
