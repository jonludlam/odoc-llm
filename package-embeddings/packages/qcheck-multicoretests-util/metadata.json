Each function directly compares values of its target type for equality, supporting both simple and nested data structures. Concrete use cases include validating expected outcomes in test cases, comparing serialized data structures, and ensuring consistency in concurrent computations.",

It supports user-defined types through configurable printers that handle n-ary constructors and nested data, enabling use cases like debugging complex data structures, generating OCaml code snippets, or logging structured values with precise formatting and optional truncation.",

      "description": "This module provides utilities for testing and debugging multicore applications, offering functions to repeat and time out property checks, handle exceptions safely, and format execution traces in sequential or parallel layouts. It includes submodules for precise equality comparisons across primitives and structured types, and for generating OCaml-syntax output of complex values with customizable formatting. Main data types include functions, lists, tuples, and user-defined structures, with operations like equality checks, trace visualization, and value serialization. You can use it to validate concurrent computations, debug nested data transformations, or generate readable logs of program execution.",
