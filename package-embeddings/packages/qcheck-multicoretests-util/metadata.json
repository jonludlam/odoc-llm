It enables customization through component-specific pretty-printers, facilitating tasks like debugging, code generation, or data serialization. Operations handle common primitives such as integers, strings, and options, while maintaining syntactic validity and readability.",

Each function takes two values of a specific type and returns a boolean indicating equality. Used to implement precise equality checks in testing, serialization, and data comparison scenarios.",

It supports generating readable OCaml syntax for values like tuples, lists, and records, and provides precise equality checks for types including options, results, and arrays. Users can customize output formatting and ensure accurate comparisons in testing and data processing workflows. Examples include printing nested data structures or verifying deep equality between two lists of custom records.",
