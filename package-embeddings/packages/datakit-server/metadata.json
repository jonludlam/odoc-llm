It works with session values of any type `'a`, formatting each update using a provided `Fmt.t` function. Concrete use cases include real-time log file generation and dynamic status reporting where file content reflects changing internal state.",

It provides the `(>>*=)` operator to chain operations that may fail with filesystem errors, enabling concise error propagation. Use this module to handle sequences of asynchronous filesystem actions where each step depends on the success of the previous.",

It works with `Vfs.Inode.t` values, representing directory entries, and uses maps or dynamic functions to build read-only or mutable directories. Concrete use cases include modeling virtual directories backed by static lists, mutable maps, or custom logic for virtual filesystems in testing or emulation environments.",

It works with abstract file representations (`t`), file descriptors (`fd`), and session-driven streams that generate content in real time based on state changes. Use cases include modeling mutable or immutable files with runtime-defined behavior, implementing virtual devices that respond to session context, and handling errors with predefined status codes during file operations.",
