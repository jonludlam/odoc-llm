It supports sequential binding of Lwt-promises, enabling the transformation of success values before proceeding. Key operations include binding and mapping over Lwt-result values, allowing for structured error handling. For example, it can be used to fetch data from an API, process the response, and then write to a database, with errors propagated automatically through the chain.",
