It provides the `(>>*=)` operator to sequence operations that return `('a, Vfs.Error.t) Result.result Lwt.t`, enabling concise error propagation. Use this module when composing asynchronous operations over a virtual filesystem where each step may fail with a specific error code.",

      "description": "This module enables the creation and management of file descriptors with custom read and write logic, metadata manipulation, and dynamic content generation through streams. It supports data types such as file descriptors, virtual inodes, and error values, allowing operations like constructing files from strings or command-driven sources, simulating filesystem errors, and tracking file state. The child module extends this functionality by providing a streaming interface that dynamically updates content based on session state, using formatters to expose changing data as textual lines. Together, they support use cases like virtual files that generate data on demand, real-time log monitoring, and abstract hierarchical data management.",

It supports both synchronous and Lwt-based asynchronous error handling workflows, particularly through the infix operator `(>>*=)` in its child module, which sequences result-returning Lwt computations that propagate error codes. Use it to handle and compose errors from operations like file access, directory traversal, and offset validation in a virtual filesystem.",

It works with `Vfs.Dir.t` as the abstract type for directories and interacts with `Vfs.Inode.t` for file and directory entries, using `Vfs.perm` for permission settings. Concrete use cases include building static or dynamic read-only directories, enforcing directory-only contents, and handling common filesystem operations with specific error codes like `err_already_exists` or `err_no_entry`.",

Key data types include inodes, directories, file descriptors, and error codes such as `Noent` and `Perm`, enabling use cases like emulated filesystems, custom storage backends, and testing environments.
