Operates on image types, pixel expressions, and input sources to generate output images. Used to merge multiple pixel operations into a single pipeline, evaluate pre-defined expressions, and render images based on specified dimensions and color configurations.",

Works with image data structured as 2D arrays of pixel values, typically represented as 8-bit or 32-bit unsigned integers.

Processes image types, pixel expressions, and input sources to generate output images based on defined parameters. Supports merging multiple operations into a single workflow, evaluating pre-defined expressions, and rendering images with specified dimensions and color settings. Examples include blending layers, applying filters, and generating thumbnails.",
