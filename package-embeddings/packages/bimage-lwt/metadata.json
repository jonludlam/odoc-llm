It constructs filters from expressions that manipulate image pixels, supporting operations like joining multiple expressions or evaluating them directly on input images. Concrete use cases include asynchronous image processing tasks such as brightness adjustment, color filtering, or edge detection on pixel data streams.",

      "description": "This module enables asynchronous pixel manipulation of images using Lwt, allowing the construction and evaluation of filters from expressions that transform pixel data. It supports operations such as joining multiple expressions into a single filter, and applying them to input images for tasks like brightness adjustment, color filtering, and edge detection. The core data types include expressions representing pixel transformations and filters that encapsulate these operations. For example, users can define an expression to increase brightness, combine it with a color filter, and apply the result asynchronously to an image stream.",
