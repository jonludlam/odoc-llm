It provides functions to create icon instances with customizable properties such as size, anchor points, and URLs for retina or shadow images, and allows setting a default image path for fallback use. Concrete use cases include customizing marker appearance in a map application, such as defining icon offsets for precise placement or using HTML content for interactive icons.",

It provides functions to add or remove layers from a map, bind and control popups, and handle events specific to each layer type. Concrete use cases include displaying geographic data with `create_geojson`, adding interactive markers with popup support, and rendering polylines or circle markers on a map.",

It supports operations like setting geographical views, fitting maps to world bounds, and managing popups, while working with data types such as latitude-longitude coordinates, zoom levels, and DOM elements. Concrete use cases include embedding dynamic maps in web pages, updating map display in response to user actions, and integrating event handlers for map interactions.",

It works with discriminated unions `t` and `sub` to represent event instances and event subscriptions, along with types like `Leaflet.Point.t` and `Leaflet.Latlng.t` for geospatial data. Concrete use cases include handling map click events, retrieving mouse coordinates, and processing error events with specific error codes and messages.",
