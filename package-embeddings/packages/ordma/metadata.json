It provides functions to send and receive data over a lightweight socket connection, specifying offsets and lengths for precise memory control. Typical use cases include handling binary protocols or streaming data where direct memory manipulation is required.",

It provides core functions for connecting, sending, receiving, binding, and managing socket options, including non-blocking configuration. The child module organizes version metadata such as major, minor, and patch levels along with a git revision string, accessible via structured values like `summary` for compatibility checks and diagnostics. Together, they support efficient binary data handling and version-aware networking applications.",
