It works with database handles (`bdb`) and cursors (`bdbcur`) to enable efficient range queries, prefix scans, and atomic updates, while offering lifecycle management (creation, deletion, synchronization) and performance tuning (caching, defragmentation). Typical use cases include embedded storage systems requiring fine-grained data access, transactional consistency, or large-scale key-value range operations with Berkeley DB integration.",
