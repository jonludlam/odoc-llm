It defines integer and character constants for error codes, file types, and open flags (e.g., `enoent`, `dt_DIR`, `o_CREAT`), alongside C-compatible structures for Unix directory entries (`dirent`) and extended file statistics (`statx`), including fields for inode numbers, timestamps, and file modes. These bindings enable use cases like error handling in CephFS operations, type-safe file attribute checks (e.g., distinguishing directories from regular files via `s_IFDIR`), and retrieving metadata such as file sizes or modification times.",

It works with structured types such as `mount_info` and uses a result type to encapsulate success or error states, interacting with file paths, descriptors, and directory handles. It is suited for implementing virtual filesystems, storage backends, or tools requiring fine-grained control over file operations and extended attributes.",
