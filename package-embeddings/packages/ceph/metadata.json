It includes field accessors for metadata like inode numbers, timestamps, and file sizes, as well as type masks (e.g., `s_IFREG`, `s_IFDIR`) to distinguish file categories such as regular files, directories, and symlinks. These features enable low-level filesystem operations, metadata inspection, and type-specific handling in OCaml applications interfacing with CephFS or Unix-based systems.",
