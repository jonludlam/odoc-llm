      "description": "This module enables monadic sequence transformations that compose computations across two error-aware monads (`Alt` and `Mon`), supporting effectful operations like mapping, filtering, merging, and grouping over sequences of type `('a, 'e) t`. It facilitates error-resilient data processing pipelines by allowing functions to interleave side effects (e.g., I/O, state) and conditional logic while preserving sequence structure, with applications in cooperative multitasking, stream processing, and validated data transformations. Key operations include `map`, `filter`, `sorted_merge`, and `group`, which chain monadic actions across heterogeneous effects while maintaining type safety.",
