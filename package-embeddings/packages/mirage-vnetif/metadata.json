Use cases include handling virtual machine networking, packet filtering, and network device emulation.",

It provides functions to send and receive packets via `write` and `listen`, manage MAC and MTU settings, and track interface statistics with `get_stats_counters` and `reset_stats_counters`. It is used to simulate or connect to a network backend `B` for virtualized networking, such as in unikernel environments.",
