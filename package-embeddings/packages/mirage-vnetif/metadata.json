      "description": "This module provides a virtual network interface implemented in user space, allowing packet transmission and reception through customizable backends. It centers around the `Make` functor to instantiate interfaces with specific backends, supporting operations like binding devices, sending Ethernet frames, and registering packet callbacks. Key data types include network device handles (`t`), MAC addresses, and `Cstruct.t` buffers, with core functionality extended through submodules that manage device registration, packet handling, and backend integration. It enables use cases such as virtual machine networking, protocol testing, and custom packet filtering by combining direct API operations with modular backend-driven implementations.",
