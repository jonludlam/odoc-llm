It includes specialized functions like `on_error` and `on_error_msg` to handle and log error cases within `result` values, allowing custom formatting and error recovery strategies. These capabilities are used to instrument client-side Twirp operations, such as logging request failures or debugging network interactions.",

It works with headers as string pairs, error types for Twirp-specific failures, and string-truncation utilities for safe logging. It is used to construct and dispatch Twirp RPC calls, process returned errors, and manage client-side metadata such as authentication tokens or content types.",

It includes operations to convert error codes to their corresponding message and HTTP status, retrieve documentation for each error, and access a list of all error codes with their associated metadata. Concrete use cases include handling RPC failures, routing errors, authentication issues, rate limiting, and data integrity problems in Twirp-based services.",
