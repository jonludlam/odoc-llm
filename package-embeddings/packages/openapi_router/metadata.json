It leverages references, maps, and input value checks to manage complex schema elements and enforce validation rules. Use cases include building reusable schema components and ensuring data conformity to strict format requirements.",

It operates on structured types like parameter objects, security schemes, paths, responses, and headers, enabling manipulation of API specifications and their JSON representations. Use cases include generating human-readable API documentation, validating schema conversions, and integrating with tools that require structured API metadata.",
