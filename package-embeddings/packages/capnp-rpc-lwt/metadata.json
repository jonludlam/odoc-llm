It supports direct operations on `StructRef.t` and `Response.t` types, allowing implementors to wrap results as promises, return empty or immediate responses, and manage error handling. The child module extends this by enabling explicit resource management and response creation with or without initial content. Together, they facilitate implementing RPC methods that produce structured results, handle asynchronous computation, and manage reference lifetimes during message transmission.",

It introduces core types like capability references and operations such as `with_ref` for automatic cleanup and `pp` for introspection, allowing method calls on both local and remote objects or unresolved promises. Child modules handle the construction and management of invocation requests, enabling creation of Capn'Proto-based payloads and explicit resource release during client-server communication. Example usage includes invoking remote methods while chaining unresolved promises, or inspecting capability state during distributed system interactions.",
