It operates on capability references (`Capability.t`), method identifiers, and Cap\u2019n Proto message structures, with utilities for safe resource handling and error propagation. This facilitates distributed system development where capabilities represent transient or remote services, requiring precise control over asynchronous interactions and resource ownership.",
