It supports operations to create a trie node, set and get values at specific paths, remove path associations, and navigate to sub-nodes. Concrete use cases include efficient prefix-based lookups, such as autocomplete systems or dictionary implementations with key hierarchies.",

It works with nodes that store optional values and paths that represent key sequences leading to those values.

It supports prefix-based searches and hierarchical data organization, enabling concrete use cases such as auto-complete systems, dictionary implementations, and IP routing tables. The structure allows setting, retrieving, and removing values at specific paths, with child modules providing operations for node manipulation and path-based access. Examples include storing words with associated definitions, routing paths in networking, or hierarchical configuration data.",
