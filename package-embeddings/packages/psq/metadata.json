It includes priority-driven functions like `min`, `pop`, and `fold_at_most` to process elements in key-ascending order, alongside key-based filtering and pretty-printing for scenarios requiring structured data manipulation. Use cases include task scheduling, event processing, and systems needing dynamic priority-based data retrieval.",
