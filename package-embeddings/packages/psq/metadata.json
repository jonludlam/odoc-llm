It operates on a purely functional priority search queue storing unique keys, ordered by ascending keys for standard operations and ascending priorities for priority-based traversals. Use cases include scheduling systems requiring unique identifiers with dynamic priorities and resource management scenarios where entries must be processed based on priority thresholds.",

Works with ordered key types and prioritizes elements based on associated values.
