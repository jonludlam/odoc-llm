It enables field-level serialization with contextual metadata handling and error propagation, designed for implementing structured data encoders like JSON or binary formats that require tracking state during traversal of complex OCaml data graphs.",

It operates on a shared `state` and context (`ctx`), using visitor-based traversal to extract and convert values, with detailed error handling via result types. This functionality is commonly used in scenarios like parsing binary formats, decoding network messages, or transforming configuration files into typed data structures.",

It provides a default configuration value with `camelcase_fields` set to `false`. Useful when deserializing JSON objects to control the mapping of field names to OCaml record fields.",

These operations employ visitors and structured decoding strategies to parse serialized formats like JSON or binary, supporting optional fields, enums, and nested structures while returning explicit error results for invalid data. It is suited for use cases requiring precise schema alignment, such as API response processing or configuration file parsing, where type fidelity and robust error handling are critical.",

It provides low-level operations to build custom deserializers for formats like JSON or MessagePack, handling integers, strings, options, records, and variants with result-typed error handling. The module works with a shared parsing state and context, enabling efficient traversal and conversion of serialized data into typed OCaml values.
