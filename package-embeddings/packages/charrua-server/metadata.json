It operates on DHCP packets, lease databases, and configuration data, returning a result that dictates the next action the server should take. Concrete use cases include handling DHCP discovery, request, and release messages to manage IP address allocation and respond to client queries.",

It operates on a DHCP lease database that maps client identifiers to IPv4 addresses, supporting queries to validate address availability, allocate usable addresses within specified ranges, and enforce lease state transitions. The functionality is specifically designed for handling DHCP request workflows, ensuring conflict-free IP distribution and maintaining lease persistence across server restarts.",
