It works with IP addresses, MAC addresses, DHCP options, and network prefixes to define server behavior, including lease times, address ranges, and host-specific settings. Concrete use cases include initializing a DHCP server with a predefined configuration file or programmatically creating configurations for dynamic network environments.",

It operates on DHCP packets, MAC addresses, and monotonic time values, returning structured outcomes like replies, warnings, or lease database updates.

It works with lease records containing timestamps, client identifiers, and IPv4 addresses, along with lease databases that track dynamic address assignments. These functions support critical DHCP server tasks like handling lease lifetimes, resolving client address requests, and ensuring efficient reuse of expired or freed IP addresses.",
