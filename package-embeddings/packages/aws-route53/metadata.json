      "description": "This module provides DNS management and traffic routing capabilities for AWS Route 53, enabling programmatic control over hosted zones, health checks, traffic policies, and query logging. Key data types include hosted zone IDs, record sets, health check configurations, traffic policies, and VPC associations, with operations to create, delete, update, and query these resources via the Route 53 API. You can use it to automate DNS failover with health checks, configure latency-based routing using traffic policies, enable DNS query logging to CloudWatch, and manage reusable delegation sets across multiple zones. Specific examples include validating DNS routing policies before deployment, retrieving health check statuses for monitoring, and programmatically associating VPCs with hosted zones for private DNS resolution.",
