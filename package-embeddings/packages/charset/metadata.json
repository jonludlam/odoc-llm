      "description": "The module provides functional and persistent set operations for characters, including union, intersection, and difference, alongside transformations like `map` and `filter`. It works with immutable character sets (`Charset.t`) and supports conversions to and from sequences and lists, enabling efficient iteration and predicate-based processing through higher-order functions such as `fold` and `exists`. This is particularly useful in text processing applications like input validation, lexical analysis, or character set manipulation where immutability and efficient structural comparisons are required.",
