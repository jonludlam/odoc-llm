These operations are useful for low-level data processing, compression algorithms, and optimizing performance-critical code.",

It operates on ordered sets of characters (represented as `Charset.t`) and individual characters (`Charset.elt`), supporting conversions to and from lists and sequences. Typical applications include text processing tasks requiring efficient set-based character analysis, such as validating character subsets, filtering specific symbols, or aggregating character ranges from sequential data sources.",
