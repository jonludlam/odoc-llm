      "description": "This module provides equality checks, pretty-printing, and string conversion operations for structured shell syntax elements, including commands, patterns, assignments, and location-aware data. It works with nested AST types like located values, descriptions, programs, and case items, along with metadata-rich constructs such as character ranges and attributes. These utilities support tasks like parsing validation, debugging output, and analyzing shell script structures with precise location tracking.",

Works with types like `lexing_position`, `position`, and `'a located`, which embed location metadata within structured data. Enables precise error reporting and debugging by preserving and formatting location information alongside parsed elements.",

It handles nested CST nodes, variant syntactic forms (e.g., quoted words, I/O redirects), and location-aware transformations, mapping constructs like loops, conditionals, and function definitions to their AST equivalents. Use cases include parsing shell scripts, analyzing program flow, and processing complex syntax with metadata.",
