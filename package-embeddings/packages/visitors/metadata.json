It works with OCaml's internal type representations, such as core_type, substitutions, and renamings, enabling tasks like variable tracking, type parameter conversion, and attribute manipulation. Specific use cases include handling polymorphic type definitions, managing opaque types, and ensuring correct type substitutions during AST processing.",

It works with OCaml parsetree elements, long identifiers, and AST structures to enable metadata extraction and diagnostic reporting. Users can instrument class definitions to access field information at runtime and track parsing issues through structured warnings. Examples include generating field accessors, embedding metadata in ASTs, and extracting warnings for error analysis.",
