It works with the `Serial__.Connection.t` type to maintain and manipulate the state of a serial port during data transmission. Concrete use cases include tracking buffer contents, handling interrupts, and managing low-level device settings.",

      "description": "This module orchestrates serial communication protocols for interacting with hardware devices, offering functions to open connections at specified baud rates, asynchronously read and write lines or raw data, and wait for targeted responses with optional timeouts. It centers around the `Serial__.Connection.t` type, which represents an active serial port connection, and supports operations like buffer management, interrupt handling, and device configuration through its child module. You can use it to send commands to a microcontroller and parse sensor data in real time.",

      "description": "This module manages serial communication by establishing connections and handling data transfer with functions like `read_line`, `write_line`, and `wait_for_line`, centered around the `Serial__.Connection.t` type. The internal state module provides access to connection-specific state data, enabling precise control and monitoring of active serial links. The protocol module extends this functionality with tools to open ports at specific baud rates, manage buffers, handle interrupts, and coordinate device interactions. Together, these components support tasks like sending commands to microcontrollers, capturing sensor data, and automating serial device workflows with custom triggers or real-time input.",
