It provides a function `sexp_of_t` to convert these print rule values into S-expressions. This module is used to control when test output should be printed during asynchronous test execution, particularly in cases where output should only appear on failure or always be shown.",

      "description": "This module provides tools for managing temporary directories, environment variables, and process execution in asynchronous expect tests. It includes functions for running child processes with captured output, setting up controlled environments, and handling exceptions in async functions, supporting use cases like testing CLI interactions and isolating filesystem operations. A polymorphic variant type `t` with values `Always`, `If_unclean_exit`, and `Never` controls when test output is printed, and is convertible to S-expressions via `sexp_of_t`. These features combine with submodules to offer precise control over test execution, output, and environmental conditions.",
