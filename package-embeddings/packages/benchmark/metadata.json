It supports operations to build, merge, prefix, and filter benchmark trees, and allows benchmark execution with latency or throughput metrics. Concrete use cases include timing functions at various input sizes, grouping related benchmarks under named paths, and selectively running subsets of benchmarks based on command-line arguments.",
