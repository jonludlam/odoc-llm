Works with `t` (benchmark trees), `path` (string lists), and `arg_state` (command-line parsing state). Used to build hierarchical benchmarks, filter execution paths, and integrate with command-line arguments for selective benchmark runs.",

Supports types `t` (benchmark trees), `path` (string lists), and `arg_state` (command-line parsing state), with operations like `@>`, `@>>`, `concat`, and `filter`. Example: build a tree with named nodes, filter specific paths for execution, or merge multiple benchmarks into a single structure. Can be used to organize complex benchmark suites, selectively run subsets of tests, or combine results from different execution paths.",
