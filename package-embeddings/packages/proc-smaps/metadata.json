It works with string-convertible keys to index memory statistics and supports inspecting attributes such as swapped memory size (`swap_pss`) and locked memory size (`locked`) in smaps entries. These tools are used to analyze memory allocation details, including shared or private page sizes and swapping behavior, within process memory mappings.",
