It operates on memory region descriptors to expose granular attributes such as locked status, huge page utilization, and clean/dirty page counts. These capabilities are particularly useful for memory profiling, resource monitoring, and optimizing memory allocation strategies in system-level applications.",

It includes operations to query and summarize memory statistics such as RSS, shared RSS, and swap usage, both directly and through submodules that expose granular attributes like locked pages, huge page utilization, and clean/dirty page counts. The primary data type is a list of memory region descriptors, each supporting detailed inspection of memory layout and usage. Example uses include identifying memory-heavy mappings, analyzing page type distributions, and formatting per-process memory reports for system monitoring and optimization.",
