It operates on a `key` type representing identifiers or resources, with operations tailored for monitoring memory statistics and enforcing access control. Use cases include tracking memory usage patterns and managing locked resources in concurrent environments.",

Works with structured data types representing memory mappings, such as `Smaps.t`, which includes fields like `pathname`, `perms`, and methods to retrieve specific metrics. Used to inspect memory usage of processes, such as determining the size of the `/bin/bash` executable in a running process.",

It defines a `key` type and offers conversions from strings to these keys, along with checks for lock status. This supports tasks like monitoring memory metrics and preventing race conditions in multi-threaded applications. For example, it can identify which memory regions are locked or map string identifiers to internal tracking keys.",
