It works with `Metadb.Path.root` values representing file paths and environment variables. Concrete use cases include preparing directories for new library entries, cleaning up empty directories, or launching files with their default applications.",

It works with JSON configuration files, hidden `.metadata` directories storing per-file metadata, and indexed data structures that map relative file paths to entries, leveraging MD5 hashes to track file identity across moves or renames. Use cases include cross-library duplicate detection, metadata synchronization after file migrations, and robust file reference resolution when directories are restructured.",

It works directly with a custom JSON type that supports primitives, associative lists, and nested structures, enabling precise handling of metadata files and configuration entries. Concrete operations include reading and writing JSON to files, extracting and modifying specific fields in configuration or metadata entries, and converting between JSON values and native OCaml types for tasks like version checks or path updates.",

It stores metadata in hidden `.metadata` directories using per-file JSON files, with libraries organized by root paths and configured through JSON files that record names, paths, and metadata versions. Users can manipulate file paths with type-safe operations, manage library configurations, and perform system-level file actions like moving or opening files. The library supports metadata serialization, hash computation, and JSON parsing, enabling robust metadata synchronization, version handling, and content-based file identification.",
