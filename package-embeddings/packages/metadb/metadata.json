It supports constructing, merging, and converting between absolute and relative paths, along with inspecting components like file extensions and hidden file status, while validating path integrity during debugging. These capabilities are used to manage library directories, resolve moved or renamed files via hash-based tracking, and handle configuration metadata in JSON files.",

It supports operations like key-based access in associative lists, type-safe extraction of values (int, string, bool), and reading/writing JSON to files or strings. Concrete use cases include loading and saving library metadata from configuration files, extracting specific fields from JSON objects, and modifying JSON structures during database updates or file metadata synchronization.",

It works with JSON-stored configurations tracking library directories, versioned metadata entries for individual files, and MD5 hashes to resolve file identity across renames or moves. Key use cases include detecting duplicate files across directories, recovering missing files via content hashes, and maintaining consistent metadata when files are relocated between libraries.",

It works with `Metadb.Path.root` as the primary data structure for file paths and interacts directly with the filesystem. Concrete use cases include preparing directories for new library entries, removing outdated files, or launching files from the database using their associated applications.",

It organizes file metadata by library, each associated with a directory in the home path, and stores configuration data in JSON files. Key operations include hash-based file identification, path-safe directory management, and JSON metadata manipulation for persisting and synchronizing library state.",
