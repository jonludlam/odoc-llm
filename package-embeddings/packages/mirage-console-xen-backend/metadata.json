      "description": "This module tracks and manages event channel activations, providing precise synchronization with Xen event channels. It allows waiting for events that occur after a specified event on a given channel, supporting efficient event-driven I/O in a Xen backend context. A typical use case involves coordinating domain resume operations by detecting event channel triggers after system wake-up.",

It provides functions to create, destroy, and manage console sessions with specific domain IDs and port identifiers, supporting live migration and resource cleanup. Use cases include handling guest console I/O in virtualized environments and coordinating console access between domains.",

It works with Xen console endpoints using `t` as the connection handle, `Cstruct.t` for buffers, and structured error types for failures. Use it to implement console clients that send and receive data streams, such as remote shells or logging daemons in Xen-based virtual machines.",

      "description": "This module implements a Xen backend console interface for MirageOS, enabling bidirectional communication between guest and host through shared memory rings and event channels. It provides core operations for reading from and writing to console connections, tracking I/O statistics, and managing activation events, with concrete use cases in logging unikernel output and supporting interactive shells. The interface coordinates virtual console sessions using Xenstore and ring buffers, allowing creation, destruction, and management of connections tied to specific domain IDs and ports. Submodules enhance this functionality by handling event-driven I/O synchronization, supporting live migration, and implementing client-side console operations with structured error handling and asynchronous data streams.",
