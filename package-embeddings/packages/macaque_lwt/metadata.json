It includes type conversion utilities for serializing/deserializing database-specific data like JSONB, timestamps, and arrays, along with parsing string inputs into structured OCaml types. Additional functions support monadic operations for array handling and define custom types for database-compatible structures such as hstore, jsonb, and time zones.",
