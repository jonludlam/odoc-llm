It provides operations to write requests, push updates, wait for free slots, and poll for responses, all while handling concurrency and synchronization. Use cases include efficient inter-process communication in distributed systems or virtualized environments where low-latency data exchange is critical.",

      "description": "This module provides an Lwt-based interface for bidirectional communication over a shared memory ring, enabling efficient inter-process interactions. It supports server-side response delivery and client-side request submission using `Ring.buf`, with operations for asynchronous waiting, polling, and state management via `('a, 'b) Lwt_ring.Back.t`. You can use it to implement low-latency, concurrent communication between processes, such as in virtualized environments or distributed systems requiring fast data exchange. Example usage includes sending client requests and receiving server responses without blocking, leveraging shared memory for performance.",
