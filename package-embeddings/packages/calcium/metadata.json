It operates directly on `Calcium.CA.t` values using a provided context to control evaluation behavior. These operations are used for efficient expression manipulation in symbolic computation tasks like expression simplification and caching.",

It operates on algebraic numbers (`t`) and provides functions to construct them from roots or enclosures, extract their defining polynomials, and inspect their properties. Concrete use cases include symbolic-numeric hybrid computations and certified root isolation in polynomial systems.",
