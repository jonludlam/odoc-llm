      "description": "This module implements fast structural comparison and hashing for Calcium expressions using context-dependent operations. It provides `compare`, `equal`, and `hash` functions that operate directly on `Calcium.CA.t` values, enabling efficient use in data structures like sets and maps. These operations are optimized for performance in scenarios such as expression deduplication and cache key generation.",

      "description": "This module provides precise arithmetic and symbolic manipulation of complex algebraic numbers through exact operations like equality checks, sign determination, exponentiation with integer or rational exponents, and conversions between types such as `QQBAR.t` and `CA.t`. It supports interoperability with integers, rationals, and Flint numeric types (`FMPZ`, `FMPQ`) within a computational context (`CTX.t`), enabling exact comparisons, simplifications, and numerical evaluations. The child module enhances efficiency by implementing fast structural comparison, equality, and hashing for Calcium expressions, crucial for deduplication and cache management. For example, users can compute roots of polynomials exactly, simplify nested expressions, or use `CA.t` values as keys in maps for symbolic computation workflows.",

      "description": "This module implements exact representations of algebraic numbers through the `t` type, supporting precise equality and ordering checks via `equal` and `compare`. It provides direct access to the underlying integer polynomial defining an algebraic number with `poly`, and allows conversion to approximate complex intervals using `enclosure`. Concrete use cases include symbolic computation, exact geometric predicates, and certified root isolation in polynomial systems.",
