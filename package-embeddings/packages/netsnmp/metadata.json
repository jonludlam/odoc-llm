      "description": "This module implements asynchronous SNMP client operations for querying and traversing MIB objects, supporting symbolic and raw OID lookups, MIB module loading, and SNMPv3-aware connections. It provides key operations for fetching values by OID, resolving symbolic names, and navigating MIB trees via get-next requests, working with core data types such as SNMP sessions, PDUs, OIDs, and MIB nodes. The module enables dynamic loading of vendor-specific MIBs, conversion of human-readable OIDs to structured formats, and direct session management with authentication and custom parameters. Use cases include network device monitoring, MIB inspection, and asynchronous SNMP data retrieval or modification with proper session cleanup.",
