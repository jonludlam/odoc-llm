It works with C-style structures and pointers to handle socket resources and protocol conversions. Concrete use cases include establishing a connection to the Linux kernel for routing and network device management via Netlink messages.",

It centers around data types like `addr` and integrates with system libraries to manage network interfaces, routing tables, and socket communication. The `Socket` submodule handles kernel-level Netlink connections, while `Cache` and `Address` provide in-memory representations and IP address management for network link objects. Use cases include querying interface statistics, modifying routing entries, and inspecting network device properties through structured Netlink messages.",
