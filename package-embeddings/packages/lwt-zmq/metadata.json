It supports receiving messages by waiting for sender IDs and data, and sending structured payloads to specific targets. The module uses Lwt for non-blocking I/O and defines a private identity type to ensure safe message handling. Examples include broadcasting updates to registered clients or querying a specific component for status information.",
