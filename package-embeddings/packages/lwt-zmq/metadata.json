It provides `recv` and `send` functions to handle messages tagged with string-based identifiers, allowing asynchronous communication between endpoints. Use this to build event-driven network services that route messages based on client identifiers.",

      "description": "This module wraps ZeroMQ sockets for non-blocking use with Lwt, enabling asynchronous message reception and transmission for both single-part and multi-part messages. It supports direct operations like `recv`, `send`, `recv_all`, and `send_all` on ZeroMQ socket objects, facilitating event-driven network communication in patterns such as request-response or pub-sub. The router submodule extends this functionality for string-identified message routing, providing `recv` and `send` variants that handle tagged messages asynchronously. Together, they enable building non-blocking, concurrent network services that efficiently route and process messages without blocking the Lwt event loop.",

It enables non-blocking observation of socket events such as connections and errors, and supports asynchronous message transmission and reception for both simple and multipart messages. The router submodule enhances this functionality by allowing message routing based on string identifiers, enabling efficient handling of tagged messages in patterns like request-response or pub-sub. Example uses include tracking client activity in real time, sending and receiving messages without blocking the event loop, and routing messages to specific endpoints based on identity tags.",
