It works with polymorphic values and a fixed key type, enabling functional transformations such as mapping, folding, and merging with custom logic. Designed for scenarios requiring strict parameter handling, it facilitates tasks like parsing or validating structured data with dynamic key-value relationships.",

      "description": "This module combines calendar data manipulation with structured key-value handling and serialization capabilities. It supports constructing and parsing hierarchical calendar components like events and alarms, with timezone-aware timestamps and recurrence rules, while its parameterized map submodule enables precise management of calendar properties and dynamic key-value associations. Operations include adding recurrence exceptions, serializing durations to ICS format, and transforming event data with custom extensions. Together, these features allow tasks such as generating recurring schedules, normalizing time zone data, and producing valid iCalendar files with rich metadata.",
