It supports direct operations on strings and integrates with submodules implementing hash sets, hash tables, maps, and sets that all support serialization, diffing, and version-agnostic binary and S-expression conversions. You can, for example, compute a hash of a UTF-8 string, then store it in a serializable hash set or use it as a key in a binary-protocol-enabled hash table. The submodules also allow diffing and synchronizing maps and sets, useful for distributed state updates or persistent storage.",

It works with arbitrary values of type `'a` and the abstract type `'a Heap_block.t`, allowing creation, unwrapping, and size measurement of heap blocks. Concrete use cases include ensuring correct behavior when registering values with finalizers or storing them in weak pointers, where precise heap allocation guarantees are required.",
