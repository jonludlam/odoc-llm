It supports tree conversions via `of_ktree` and `map_ktree`, and formatting text content using `sprintf` and `asprintf`. These structures are used to declaratively compose and render nested textual layouts, such as pretty-printing code or structured data.",

It works with structured text components, allowing precise control over spacing, positioning, and visual attributes such as colors or bold text, and is suited for generating formatted terminal UIs, tables, or hierarchical data visualizations. Additional features include HTML link embedding, declarative nested layout composition, and utilities for mapping styled text to complex hierarchical structures like trees or records.",
