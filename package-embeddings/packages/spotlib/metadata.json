It supports operations like binding, mapping, and error continuation, allowing transformations between success and error states and conversions to and from `option` types. Infix operators from submodules enable idiomatic pipelines for chaining and combining result values, such as using `>>=` for sequencing or `>>|` for mapping successes, while utility functions like `ok`, `ng`, and `from_Ok` support result construction and extraction. Together, these features facilitate concise error propagation and composition in workflows involving validation, optional results, or effectful operations.",

Main data types revolve around file paths and status information, with operations supporting both direct file manipulation and conditional checks based on filesystem metadata. Example uses include safely writing configuration files, filtering log entries by line, and verifying directory containment or file integrity before processing.",
