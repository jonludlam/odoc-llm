It supports operations like `put` to store a promise, `take` to remove and return a binding, and `bind` to wait for a resolved value and apply a function. It works with keys from the parameter module `C` and values wrapped in `result` type promises, making it suitable for caching fallible asynchronous operations like network requests or file reads.",
