It works with keys defined by the parameter module and stores values wrapped in Lwt promises, allowing for asynchronous resolution and transformation. Concrete use cases include caching asynchronous computations with controlled memory usage and managing concurrent promise-based operations with dynamic key-based access.",

It supports operations like `put` to insert promise bindings, `take` to remove and return promises, and `bind` to process resolved values, with policies for size limits and promise cancellation. Use cases include caching asynchronous computations where failures should evict entries, such as retrying network requests or managing transient state.",

It supports key-value storage with specialized handling for `result`, `option`, and plain promise values, allowing operations like `put`, `take`, and `bind` to manage resolution, transformation, and cleanup. Submodules offer size-bounded caches that evict entries based on limits or resolution outcome, such as removing failed promises or `None` results.
