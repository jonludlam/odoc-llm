It supports typed key-value bindings, optional computation chaining, and dynamic context manipulation, allowing functions to access or override contextual data in a thread-safe way. With its core operations and child module extensions, it facilitates managing contextual state in asynchronous or concurrent applications, such as tracking request identifiers or user authentication data across a server\u2019s call stack.",
