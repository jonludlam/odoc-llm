Works with custom types such as `t` for stateful contexts, `page_aligned_buffer` for memory blocks, and `pointer` for memory addresses. Enables low-level memory manipulation in systems programming scenarios like device drivers or memory managers.",

      "description": "This module provides low-level operations for manipulating node structures, including accessing and modifying keys, values, children, and metadata like page size and minimum degree, primarily working with `Cstruct.t` for binary data and `int64`-typed values. It supports indexed access and list conversions for efficient traversal and modification of node components, suitable for implementing tree-based data structures or binary serialization formats. The `value` alias for `int64` enables precise handling of numeric data in contexts requiring 64-bit integer representation.",

Works with types such as `pointer`, `allocator`, `store`, `node`, `key`, `value`, and `error` to manage persistent tree data. Used to efficiently store and query structured data in systems requiring ordered, indexed access.",

      "description": "This module provides operations to construct, inspect, and alter nodes within hierarchical data structures, focusing on managing keys, values, child pointers, and metadata such as degree and page size. It works with a node type `t` that encapsulates these components, offering precise accessors and mutators for each element. These functionalities are particularly applicable in scenarios like implementing B-trees or similar structures where dynamic node properties and child relationships are critical.",
