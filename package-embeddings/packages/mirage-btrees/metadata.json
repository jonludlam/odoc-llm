      "description": "This module offers low-level utilities for interacting with B-tree nodes stored in `Cstruct.t` buffers, enabling precise manipulation of metadata (e.g., minimum degree, leaf status, page size) and elements (keys, values, child pointers) at specific indices. It operates directly on `Cstruct.t` structures to manage structured binary memory regions, providing binary-level access to node data. Functions like `printValues` extract and format values from buffers, serving use cases such as debugging or serializing node contents into human-readable representations.",

Works with node-based data structures stored in a customizable storage backend, using an allocator for managing memory pointers. Designed for building persistent, disk-backed B-trees with support for arbitrary key and value types.",

It works directly with `Cstruct.t` to access and modify binary memory layouts, enabling precise control over storage and retrieval of structured node information. Concrete use cases include deserializing disk-stored B-tree nodes, debugging node contents via formatted output, and assembling node data for serialization.",

It works with key-value pairs, organizing keys in a sorted order to enable range queries and ordered traversal. Concrete use cases include managing indexed data storage, implementing symbol tables, and maintaining sorted collections in memory-constrained environments.",
