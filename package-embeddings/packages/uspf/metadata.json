It operates on DNS client instances, SPF contexts, and email input streams, returning structured SPF validation outcomes. Concrete use cases include validating sender domains during email reception and parsing SPF results from received email headers for policy enforcement.",

It works with lists of mechanisms and modifiers, handling their conversion to and from string representations suitable for DNS zone files. Use cases include generating valid SPF records from mechanism lists and parsing SPF strings from DNS TXT records for validation or manipulation.",
