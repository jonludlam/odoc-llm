Operates on types like `t`, `backend`, `Domain_name.t`, and custom DNS record variants, enabling retrieval of A, AAAA, or MX records, expansion of configuration macros, and parsing of SPF directives. Examples include checking if an IP address is authorized to send from a domain, generating SPF header fields, and serializing custom SPF records for DNS deployment. The module supports both analysis of incoming emails and creation of SPF records for domain owners.",
