It supports direct access to raw bytes and integrates with result types for error handling and serialization. Functions allow parsing of binary formats, error conversion, and structured logging. It can generate a pipe of decoded values or apply a function to each unpacked item.",

It includes types like 'a Deferred.Or_error.t for error-aware computations and provides logging functions with structured data and timestamps. It enables non-blocking I/O, task sequencing, and error recovery, allowing tasks such as combining multiple network requests or tracking execution flow. It also supports staged command-line execution and structured logging for debugging.",

Offers types like `Async.Log.Blocking.Output.t` and operations for managing log levels, timestamps, and color coding. Enables logging debug, info, and error messages with terminal styling, and allows configuration of logging destinations via S-expressions. Example uses include writing colored logs to files and converting console settings to serialized data for dynamic configuration.",
