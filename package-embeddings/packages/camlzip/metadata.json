It works with in-memory data, files, and channels, using custom types like `in_file` and `out_file` to manage reading and writing, along with `entry` to describe each archive member. Concrete use cases include extracting specific files from ZIP archives, building ZIP packages from in-memory data, and updating existing ZIP files with new entries or modified content.",

It operates on raw byte sequences and strings, supporting incremental processing through initialized streams and explicit flush control. Concrete use cases include implementing custom compression pipelines, verifying CRC checksums, and handling compressed network or file data in chunks.",

      "description": "This module handles reading from and writing to gzip-compressed files by providing low-level access to compressed data streams. It works with abstract types `in_channel` and `out_channel` for reading and writing operations, supporting direct manipulation of bytes, characters, and substrings during compression and decompression. Concrete use cases include processing large compressed log files without full decompression, streaming compressed data over network connections, and building custom tools for archive manipulation or incremental backups.",
