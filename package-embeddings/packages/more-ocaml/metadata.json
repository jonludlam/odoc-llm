      "description": "This module offers a comprehensive set of operations for transforming, inspecting, and traversing lists, including mapping, filtering, folding, and element-wise manipulation, alongside specialized functions for association lists and indexed processing. It works with arbitrary element lists, association lists, and sequences, enabling tasks like sorting, merging, and bidirectional conversion between list and sequence representations. Key use cases include data processing pipelines, predicate-based queries, and structured data manipulation through customizable comparison functions and traversal patterns.",

Operates on integer ranges and generic lists. Used to create sequences for iteration, filter list contents, and manage list truncation in data processing pipelines.",

Includes range generation, list slicing, and truncation, enabling precise control over list content and structure. Operations work on arbitrary lists, association lists, and sequences, facilitating data processing pipelines and structured data manipulation. Examples include generating integer sequences, filtering elements based on predicates, and converting between list and sequence representations.",
