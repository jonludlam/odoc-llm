It uses `Ocaml_version.t` and configuration options to generate variant compiler versions and determine required dependencies. Operations include resolving the correct Opam package for a given OCaml version and selecting compiler switches for cross-compilation scenarios. For example, it can identify the appropriate compiler package for OCaml 4.14.0 on a 32-bit architecture or generate a variant with flambda enabled.",

It operates on `Ocaml_version.t` values to represent version metadata, enabling use cases like dependency resolution, release tracking, and version compatibility checks in tools such as package managers or build systems. Specific features include querying all patches for a series, identifying development releases, and retrieving the most recent stable compiler versions.",

It provides functions to convert options to and from strings, apply them to version values, generate configure flags, and compare options based on version-specific rules. Use cases include parsing and modifying OCaml version strings to reflect build-time settings, and generating appropriate flags for the OCaml configure script.",

It provides core types like `t` for version values and operations to modify, format, and compare versions, enabling tasks like checking compatibility, generating compiler packages, and mapping versions to architecture-specific configurations. Submodules link versions to feature availability, source control tags, compiler options, and OPAM packages, allowing precise queries such as determining when `Flambda` became available or generating the correct opam package name for a 32-bit variant of OCaml 4.14.0. It also supports advanced use cases like resolving patch versions, applying build flags, and tracking development releases across OCaml's version history.",
