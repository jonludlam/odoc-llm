The core `t` type supports adding, removing, and querying headers while maintaining transmission order, with utilities for parsing and serializing common HTTP semantics like transfer encoding and content negotiation. It enables transformations into formats such as strings and S-expressions, facilitating integration with network protocols and strict HTTP implementations. Specific operations include cleaning duplicate headers, checking for presence efficiently, and normalizing header names without losing fidelity.",

It centers around the `buf` type for buffer management, `IO.ic` and `IO.oc` for streaming input and output, and `Cohttp.Header.t` for header handling, with operations for reading and writing HTTP messages incrementally. You can parse headers from a client request, stream a large response body using chunked encoding, or mock HTTP interactions entirely in memory without network IO. Specific examples include reading a request line and headers from a buffer, streaming a file upload in fixed-length chunks, or writing a response with a known content length to an output channel.",
