It integrates with submodules that provide ordered hash queues for LRU-style eviction, keyed map and set structures with serialization and comparison utilities, and lifecycle tracking for asynchronous resource management. Users can build caches that expire based on time or size, parse and serialize key collections from S-expressions or binary formats, and manage ordered or hashed key-value collections with custom conflict resolution. Specific capabilities include differential updates for maps and sets, efficient hashing and comparison for keyed data structures, and structured configuration of cache policies and resource handling.",
