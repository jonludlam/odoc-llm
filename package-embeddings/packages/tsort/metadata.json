It works with adjacency lists representing nodes and their dependencies, supporting operations like detecting nonexistent nodes, adding missing nodes, and finding direct and transitive dependencies. Concrete use cases include dependency resolution in build systems, task scheduling, and error detection in user-defined graphs.",
