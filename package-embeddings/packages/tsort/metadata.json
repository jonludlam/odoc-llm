It operates on graphs represented as adjacency lists of nodes and their dependencies, supporting operations like dependency resolution, cycle detection, and graph validation. Concrete use cases include scheduling tasks with prerequisites, validating dependency graphs in package managers, and identifying circular dependencies in software modules.",
