It provides functions to establish a WebSocket handshake with a server, handle incoming messages, and check the connection state. The primary data type `t` represents an active client connection, and operations include `connect` for initiating a connection and `is_closed` for monitoring its status. Concrete use cases include building asynchronous WebSocket clients for real-time communication over TCP sockets.",

The primary data type `t` represents an active connection, with operations to establish handshakes, send and receive messages, and monitor connection state. It supports creating server-side handlers for incoming WebSocket requests and client-side connections to remote servers. Example uses include implementing real-time messaging clients or Unix socket-based WebSocket services with non-blocking I/O.",
