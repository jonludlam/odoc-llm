      "description": "This module performs constant-time byte array comparisons for cryptographic operations. It provides functions to compare byte sequences of arbitrary length or fixed sizes (16 or 32 bytes), ensuring equality checks are done securely without timing leaks. These functions are used to validate cryptographic keys, signatures, or hashes where timing resistance is critical.",
