It works with two core types: `input` for the data to encode and `layout` to represent distinct encoding variants. It is used to optimize serialization size when encoding complex data with shared tags, such as in blockchain transaction formats or binary protocols where tag space is limited and efficient encoding is critical.",

It introduces core types `input` and `layout`, allowing manual specification of encoding variants and partial encodings to handle complex data layouts such as nested unions or bit-packed structures. The child module extends this by defining compact binary strategies for encoding custom types, particularly useful in constrained environments like blockchain transactions or binary protocols. Together, they support efficient serialization of complex data with shared tags, minimizing wasted space and enabling fine-grained layout control.",
