It supports operations like preparation, execution with parameter binding, result folding, mapping, and iteration, as well as portal and statement cleanup. Use cases include efficiently running parameterized queries, batch operations, and handling result sets with strongly typed rows.",

It works with the `ssl_config` type and the `Io.t` monad, enabling sequential execution of asynchronous or effectful actions. Concrete use cases include building network clients with SSL, handling exceptions in I/O chains, and ensuring cleanup actions run after operations complete.",

It provides functions to connect to a database, execute queries with parameter binding, manage transactions, and handle I/O operations through a monadic interface. Concrete use cases include building secure database clients, executing batch SQL operations efficiently, and managing transactional logic with automatic commit or rollback.",
