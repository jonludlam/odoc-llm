It centers around key types like connection handles (`t`), SSL configurations, and query results as lists of value options, with core operations including `execute`, `execute_many`, and `with_transaction`. The integrated I/O module enables monadic composition of effectful actions with SSL safety and resource cleanup, while the prepared statement module allows efficient execution of parameterized queries, batching, and streaming of large result sets. Examples include atomic transaction blocks, bulk inserts with typed parameters, and incremental retrieval of query results using portals.",
