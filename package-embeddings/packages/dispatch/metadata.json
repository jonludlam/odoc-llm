It works with custom route structures that combine string patterns and callbacks, allowing for flexible URL parsing and request handling. Operations include defining routes, extracting parameters, and invoking appropriate handlers based on path matches. For example, it can route `/users/123` to a user-detail handler or `/search?q=ocaml` to a query-processing function.",
