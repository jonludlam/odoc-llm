It provides configuration options to set parsing limits and timeouts, ensuring robust handling of HTTP-like traffic. You can build REST APIs, customize request pipelines with middleware, and implement protocol upgrades such as WebSocket or h2c based on client headers. The combination of runtime handling and fine-grained configuration enables building scalable and secure network services with tailored request processing.",
