It provides functions to share and unmap memory regions using grant references, supporting operations like `share_pages_exn` and `munmap_exn` on types such as `interface` and `share`. Concrete use cases include setting up shared buffers for virtual device communication, such as passing disk or network data between domains securely.",

It supports mapping single or multiple grants into contiguous, read-only or writable memory regions, with explicit unmapping or scoped management for cleanup. The child module extends this by providing `to_buf` to access mapped memory as `Io_page.t`, facilitating low-level data processing in virtualized device implementations. Use it to securely exchange and manipulate shared memory buffers after establishing a grant reference from a remote domain.",

It coordinates memory access through operations to share, map, and unmap pages, using types like `interface` and `share`, and includes predefined references for console and xenstore communication. The submodules extend this functionality by offering direct memory mappings into contiguous buffers accessible as `Io_page.t`, supporting efficient data exchange for virtual devices. Use it to implement device backends, handle domain suspension, or manage shared disk and network buffers securely.",
