It provides direct access to these regions through functions like `to_buf`, which retrieves the local buffer representation of a granted memory area. This enables efficient data exchange between virtual domains by allowing direct manipulation of shared memory buffers, such as reading from or writing to disk or network data structures provided by another domain.",

It operates on `grant` records containing foreign domain IDs and reference numbers, and maps them into local memory regions managed by the `Local_mapping` submodule. Concrete use cases include directly accessing disk or network buffers shared by other Xen domains, such as reading incoming network packets or writing disk I/O responses.",

It provides operations to allocate and deallocate grant references, map and unmap shared memory regions, and control access permissions for foreign domains. Concrete use cases include sharing disk or network buffers with virtual devices in guest domains, where precise control over memory access is required.",

It works with `gntref` identifiers and domain IDs to map or share memory buffers, supporting direct access to virtual device data such as network packets or disk I/O. Specific use cases include reading disk buffers from a virtual disk backend or sharing network buffers with a guest domain's virtual network device.",
