      "module_path": "Dataflow.VarMap",
      "description": "<think> Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a 2-3 sentence description of the VarMap module based on the given chunk summaries. They specified to identify main operations, data structures, and mention use cases. First, looking at the summaries. The first chunk talks about ordered maps with key-value pairs, operations like add, remove, update, check keys, fold, filter, compare. The keys have customizable ordering. So the main operations here are creating, modifying, querying, traversing maps. The data structure is ordered maps with customizable key ordering. Second chunk mentions retrieving, manipulating, iterating over bindings. Functions like finding min/max keys, splitting maps, applying functions to values. It specifies string keys and option-based or exception-based results. Also sequence-based iteration. So data structure here is map with string keys. Use cases might include scenarios where you need to process key-value pairs with string keys, like configuration settings or symbol tables. Third chunk is about a parameterized type 'a t but no specific functions. So maybe the module is generic but the actual operations are in the first two chunks. The third chunk might be a placeholder or a type definition without implementation. Putting it together: The module provides operations for ordered maps with customizable key ordering (from first chunk) and string keys (second chunk). Operations include adding, removing, updating, querying, folding, filtering, splitting, and iterating. Use cases could be configuration management, symbol tables, or data processing where ordered key operations are needed. Need to mention both the customizable ordering and string keys, and the specific use cases like handling configurations or symbolic data. Check if I need to avoid generic phrases. Instead of \"various operations\", specify the exact ones. Also, make sure not to repeat the module name. Let me structure the sentences: First sentence: Main operations (create, modify, query, traverse) with data structures (ordered maps with customizable key ordering and string keys). Second sentence: Specific functions like min/max, splitting, iteration, use cases like configuration management or symbolic data processing. Third sentence: Mention the parameterized type but since no functions, maybe not necessary. Wait, the third chunk says no specific operations, so maybe not include that. The user said to mention specific use cases where applicable. So the description should have the main operations, data structures, and use cases. Let me draft: The module offers operations for managing ordered maps with customizable key ordering, enabling creation, modification, and traversal of key-value pairs, along with functions for filtering, folding, and comparing maps. It supports string-keyed maps with features like minimum/maximum key retrieval, splitting, and sequence-based iteration, suitable for applications such as configuration management or symbolic data processing. Specific use cases include handling structured data where ordered key access and efficient updates are required. Wait, but the second chunk mentions string keys, while the first has customizable key ordering. So maybe the data structures are ordered maps with either customizable keys or string keys. Need to clarify. The first chunk's maps have customizable key ordering, the second specifically uses string keys. So the module works with ordered maps that can have either customizable key orderings or string keys. But how are they related? Maybe the module is parameterized, but the second chunk's functions are for string keys. The third chunk is a parameterized type 'a t, but no functions. So perhaps the module is generic but the summaries show two different implementations? Or maybe the first two chunks are parts of the same module. The user might be combining them. So the data structures are ordered maps with customizable key ordering (from first chunk) and string keys (second chunk). So the module works with both? Or maybe the second chunk is a specific instance with string keys. The description needs to mention both. But how? Alternatively, the first chunk's module is for ordered maps with customizable key order, and the second chunk is for string keys. So the module provides operations for both types. But the third chunk is a parameterized type without functions. Maybe the module is designed to be generic, but the summaries show specific implementations. This is a bit confusing. But according to the summaries, the first chunk's functions operate on key-value pairs with customizable key ordering. The second chunk's functions operate on a map with string keys. So the module works with different data structures: ordered maps with customizable keys and string-keyed maps. So the description should mention both. But how to phrase it concisely? Maybe: The module provides operations for ordered maps with customizable key ordering and string-keyed maps, including creation, modification, querying, and traversal, along with functions for filtering, folding, and splitting. It supports use cases like configuration management and symbolic data processing, where ordered key access and efficient updates are needed. But the user said 2-3 sentences. Let me check the example. The user's example might have two sentences. Let me make sure to include the main operations, data structures, and use cases. Also, avoid generic terms. So: The module provides",
