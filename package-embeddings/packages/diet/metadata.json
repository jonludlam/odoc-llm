It provides union, difference, intersection, and gap-finding operations, along with folding over intervals or elements, making it suitable for applications like resource allocation or time-range tracking where sparse numeric sets require optimized storage and manipulation. The core abstractions include interval types for contiguous ranges and a set type for combining these intervals into complex structures.",
