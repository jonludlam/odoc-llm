      "description": "This module provides a structured way to traverse and modify dependency graphs during package compilation, using a zipper-like interface. It supports key operations like initializing traversal, stepping through dependencies with `next`, blocking on unresolved items with `block`, and applying recursive patches with `recursive_patching`. The core data types include traversal states, package definitions, module signatures, and dependency summaries. You can use it to incrementally update and resolve dependencies in a package builder or compilation pipeline.",

      "description": "This module enables the construction, transformation, and analysis of modular structures through a suite of operations for working with modules, signatures, dictionaries, and arguments. It supports precise manipulation of module components such as definitions, signatures, and origins, with tools for comparison, combination, and structured output. For example, users can build and merge module signatures, inspect module origins to track provenance, validate interface compatibility with detailed errors, or generate schematics for code analysis and generation. Submodules extend these capabilities with focused utilities for handling dictionaries, arguments, namespaces, and divergence tracking in modular systems.",
