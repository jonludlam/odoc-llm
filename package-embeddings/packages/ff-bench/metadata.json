It works with pregenerated elements (zero, one, random values) of a structured type representing a finite field, enabling microbenchmarking of computational performance. The functionality is particularly useful for optimizing cryptographic protocols or numerical algorithms that rely on efficient finite field arithmetic.",

It operates on structured finite field elements including zero, one, and pregenerated random values, enabling precise microbenchmarking of computational performance. Users can measure execution speed of core operations, compare implementation efficiencies, and optimize code for cryptographic or numerical applications requiring finite field arithmetic. Example uses include timing addition cycles over large datasets or evaluating inversion performance across different field sizes.",
