It provides direct operations for serialization and deserialization using memory-efficient buffers like `StringBuf`, `BytesBuf`, and standard `Buffer.t`, enabling efficient binary data interchange in network protocols and compact storage of structured data. Child modules refine these operations for specific buffer types and use cases, such as parsing from strings, reading from or writing to byte buffers, and handling incremental input or output with support for multiple messages and partial reads. Examples include decoding a MessagePack value from a byte buffer, serializing a list of integers into a MessagePack byte sequence, or parsing a stream of MessagePack-encoded data from a network socket.",
