It works with raw strings and typed tag structures in various states (`Invalid`, `Parsed`, `Valid`), allowing direct manipulation of ID3v2 frames and metadata such as title, artist, and year. Concrete use cases include building or modifying ID3v2 tags in memory before writing them to an MP3 file or analyzing ID3v2 tag data without file association.",

It supports operations like setting tag fields (e.g., title, artist) and managing tag versions in memory. Use cases include constructing or editing tags before embedding them into audio files or extracting and transforming tag data for processing or display.",
