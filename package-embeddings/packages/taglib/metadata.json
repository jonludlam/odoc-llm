It works with raw string-based ID3v2 frames and maintains tag state through typed tags (`Invalid, `Parsed, `Valid). Concrete use cases include building or modifying ID3v2 tags for MP3 files without relying on file-backed tag storage, such as embedding metadata in streaming audio tools or tag editing utilities.",

      "description": "This module provides an in-memory API for working with ID3v2 tags, allowing header parsing, frame manipulation, and tag rendering. It supports creating, modifying, and validating ID3v2 tags directly in memory using raw string-based frames, with tag state tracked via types like `Invalid, `Parsed, and `Valid. You can use it to build or edit ID3v2 metadata for MP3 streams or in tag editing tools without needing file-backed storage. For example, you can construct a new ID3v2 tag from scratch, add custom frames, and render the binary output for embedding in an MP3 stream.",

It supports various audio formats like MP3, FLAC, OGG, and more, working with file types and UTF8-encoded tags. Use cases include editing track information, extracting audio properties like bitrate and duration, and saving changes to files.",

It works with UTF-8 strings and structured file objects to support tasks like batch tag updates and audio analysis, with operations for saving changes, closing files, and inspecting stream data such as duration and bitrate. The in-memory ID3v2 API allows constructing, modifying, and rendering ID3v2 tags from raw frames, supporting tag editing tools that require direct manipulation without file-backed storage. Together, these capabilities enable workflows such as building custom ID3v2 tags, editing track metadata across formats, and extracting audio properties for processing or display.",
