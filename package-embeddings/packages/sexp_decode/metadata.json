Operates on custom data structures representing targets, dependencies, and build rules. Used to automate software compilation by defining precise execution sequences based on file changes.",

Works with S-expressions represented as nested lists and atoms, supporting optional fields and variant types. Enables parsing of complex data like address books into typed OCaml values with precise field matching.",

      "description": "The module offers decoding operations for S-expressions, supporting atoms, lists, records, variants, and recursive structures via combinators that enable sequential parsing, branching, and error handling. It works with S-expressions and a custom `sexp` type, allowing flexible extraction of nested data like tuples, options, and repeated elements. Use cases include parsing configuration files, handling structured data serialization, and processing recursive or variant-rich formats with precise field control.",
