It defines core data types such as migration records with version and SQL commands, and uses drivers to abstract backend-specific behavior, enabling dynamic loading and secure connection handling via host, user, and password parameters. You can use it to automate schema updates across environments, handle migration errors with typed exceptions, or register custom drivers for new databases. Submodules structure error reporting, driver management, and connection configuration to provide a cohesive interface for reliable, reversible migrations.",
