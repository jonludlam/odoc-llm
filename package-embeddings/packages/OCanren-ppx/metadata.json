It operates on AST nodes like expressions, patterns, types, and attributes, supporting features such as control structures, data constructors, and language extensions with optional location and annotation handling. These tools are particularly useful for implementing ppx rewriters, syntax tree transformations, and custom language constructs in OCaml compilers or tooling.",

It works with values wrapped in a located type, including strings, identifiers, and arbitrary data, alongside `Ppxlib.Location.t`. It supports tasks like attaching locations to identifiers, mapping functions over located values, and formatting located strings.",

It includes submodules for constructing and manipulating OCaml abstract syntax trees, enabling creation of expressions, patterns, and types with support for language extensions and location handling. Another submodule manages located data, allowing operations on values annotated with source locations, such as mapping functions over located identifiers or formatting located strings. Together, these tools support tasks like writing ppx rewriters, transforming syntax trees, and handling source-located data in compiler tooling.",

It works with OCaml\u2019s AST types such as `expression`, `pattern`, and `location`, primarily within PPX rewriters. Use cases include parsing logic expressions into structured lists, reconstructing function arguments, and mapping over AST nodes during code transformation.",
