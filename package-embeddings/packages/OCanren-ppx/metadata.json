Supports transforming expressions, patterns, and core types while preserving metadata, and allows construction of complex language constructs like functions and conditionals. Operations include mapping over values with location preservation and converting identifiers to fully qualified forms. Can be used to generate or modify code with accurate source tracking and structural integrity.",
