Works directly with Parsetree.expression and other AST structures from the OCaml compiler library. Useful for code generation, analysis tools, and custom syntax extensions that need to inspect or modify OCaml source code during preprocessing.",

It provides functions to create, transform, and map over located values, including specialized operations for string and long identifier conversions. Use cases include attaching source positions to AST nodes or error messages during parsing and analysis.",

It operates on `Parsetree.expression`, `pattern`, and `core_type` nodes from `Astlib.Ast_500.Parsetree`, enabling code generation or transformation tasks such as dynamically building expressions, rewriting AST fragments, or embedding annotations. Specific utilities handle method sends, module bindings, and syntactic forms like `lazy`, `assert`, and `newtype`, with support for composing expressions with optional source locations and attributes.",

It provides utilities to classify expressions, extract variables, and manipulate lists of expressions, specifically supporting the implementation of logic programming languages or DSLs. Functions like `is_fresh`, `is_conde`, and `reconstruct_args` enable precise detection and transformation of logic expressions during PPX rewriting.",
