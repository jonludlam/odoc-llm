It provides functions like `get` to retrieve the current state, `put` to update it, and monadic combinators such as `bind`, `map`, and `let*` to compose stateful actions. Use cases include managing parser states, implementing interpreters, or tracking transformations over a changing environment.",

It provides functions like `map`, `bind`, and their operator aliases to chain computations that may fail, along with utilities like `mapM` and `foldM` for working with lists in a monadic context. Use cases include handling optional data in pipelines, composing functions that return `option` types, and writing conditional logic that depends on the presence or absence of values.",

It provides operations to bind, map, sequence, and manipulate computations that depend on a common read-only environment. Use cases include dependency injection, configuration management, and maintaining contextual data across function calls without explicit parameter passing.",

It supports standard monadic operations like `return`, `map`, `bind`, and their operator forms, enabling sequential composition and transformation of computations. Concrete use cases include logging or collecting intermediate results during a computation, where `foldM`, `mapM`, and `iterM` allow processing lists while accumulating values through the monad.",

It works with any type `'a t` that represents a monadic computation, supporting core operations like folding (`foldM`, `fold1M`), mapping (`mapM`, `forM`), and iteration (`iterM`) within the monad. Concrete use cases include chaining asynchronous computations, handling optional values with short-circuiting behavior, or sequencing effectful operations with error handling.",
