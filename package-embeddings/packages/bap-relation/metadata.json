      "description": "This module implements bidirectional relations between two sets using a bipartite graph structure, supporting operations to add, query, and traverse pairwise connections. It works with arbitrary key and value types `'k` and `'s`, maintaining a mapping that allows finding all values associated with a given key or vice versa. Concrete use cases include modeling dependencies between code entities, tracking variable assignments in program analysis, and computing bijections between instruction operands during binary translation.",
