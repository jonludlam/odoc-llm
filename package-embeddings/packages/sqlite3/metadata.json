Operates on custom types `unknown` and `t` representing unspecified and confirmed return codes. Used to enforce error handling by raising exceptions on non-successful return codes and determining operational outcomes programmatically.",

      "description": "This module offers conversion operations between OCaml option types and a `Data.t` type, supporting numeric, boolean, string, and SQLite-compatible data, with both exception-based and option-returning variants. It also provides type-specific conversions for a polymorphic data type, including boolean checks, string coercion, and debug representations, enabling flexible handling of heterogeneous data. These capabilities are useful for tasks like database serialization, configuration parsing, and data validation where type safety and adaptability are critical.",

Operates on database handles and uses user-supplied step, final, inverse, and value functions to process and compute results. Enables creation of sliding window calculations and cumulative aggregations within SQL queries.",
