      "description": "Provides functions to manage UDP communication, including listening for packets on specific ports, handling incoming datagrams, and sending data with optional source addresses and TTL. Operates on types such as IP addresses, Cstruct.t for packet data, and custom error types. Used to establish and terminate UDP connections, route packets based on destination ports, and transmit data with fine-grained control over network parameters.",

It operates on network flows, IP addresses, and ports, supporting both blocking and non-blocking transmission. A type `t` is defined but lacks implemented functions.",

Handles IP layer operations such as demultiplexing incoming packets, sending data with configurable options, and generating pseudoheaders for checksums. Works with IP addresses, prefixes, and connection state, enabling tasks like packet routing and network interface configuration.",

Supports IP address manipulation, packet demultiplexing, and custom error formatting, with operations for sending and receiving data over network flows. Enables precise control over packet routing, connection lifecycle, and checksum generation. Examples include routing UDP packets by port, establishing TCP data streams, and generating IP pseudoheaders for checksum calculations.",
