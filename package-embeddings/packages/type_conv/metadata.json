      "description": "This module provides functions for manipulating OCaml abstract syntax trees (ASTs), including converting types to strings, constructing application expressions, handling patterns, and generating unique identifiers. It operates on Camlp4's AST elements such as type expressions (ctyp), expressions (expr), patterns (patt), locations, and signature items, enabling tasks like type reconstruction and AST traversal. These capabilities are particularly useful in parser or macro systems for code generation, transformation, and delayed processing tasks.",

Supports generating code constructs like type declarations, application expressions, and unique identifiers, facilitating dynamic code generation and transformation. It allows for building and modifying OCaml modules at runtime, such as creating interface files from type information or generating expressions based on boolean flags. Examples include reconstructing types as strings, inserting new type declarations into a module, and generating pattern-matching code.",
