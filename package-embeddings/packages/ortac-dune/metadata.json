It works with Dune's internal data structures to enable plugin-specific behavior during build configuration. A concrete use case is extending Dune's command-line interface to support custom build rules or analysis tools.",

It works with file paths, optional string parameters, and integer timeouts to customize rule generation. It is used to programmatically construct and serialize Dune configurations for OCaml projects, particularly when integrating with testing or code generation pipelines.",

It leverages Dune's internal data structures to support plugin-specific behavior during build configuration. Key functionality includes defining and registering custom commands that can trigger build rules or analysis tools. For example, a user could add a command that generates additional build files or runs a linter as part of the build process.",

It centers around configuration structures, file paths, and command definitions, with operations for formatting Dune rules and registering Cmdliner-based commands. Users can define custom build steps, generate configuration files dynamically, or trigger analysis tools during the build process. For example, a user could create a command that generates test rules on the fly or integrates a linter into Dune's build pipeline.",
