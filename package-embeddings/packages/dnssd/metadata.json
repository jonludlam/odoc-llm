It supports creating queries, accessing underlying file descriptors for event loops, and handling responses or cancellations. Key data types include query objects and Unix file descriptors, with operations for query management and socket interaction. Examples include implementing custom DNS resolvers and integrating DNS lookups into event-driven applications.",
