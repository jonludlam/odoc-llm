It provides functions to create DNS queries, wait for responses via file descriptors, and retrieve or cancel pending queries, working directly with DNS packet types and Unix file descriptors. Concrete use cases include integrating DNS resolution into event-driven networking applications or custom DNS service discovery mechanisms.",

      "description": "This module integrates macOS DNS Service Discovery (DNS SD) functionality, enabling direct DNS query resolution and asynchronous network service discovery through low-level Unix domain socket operations. It supports key data types such as DNS resource records, packet representations, and error codes, with operations like `query` for synchronous resolution and mechanisms for handling asynchronous responses via file descriptors. Users can resolve service addresses (e.g., `_http._tcp`) and manage DNS errors precisely, while submodules facilitate integration into event-driven applications by allowing query cancellation and response polling. The combined interface bridges high-level DNS interactions with low-level system APIs for custom network discovery workflows.",
