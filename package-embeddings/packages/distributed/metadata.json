The local configuration manages standalone nodes with a simple name-based identifier, while the distributed configuration handles network addresses, ports, and peer connections using strings, integers, and lists. Together, they support setting up isolated test nodes or fully networked processes with customizable communication topologies. Example uses include defining a local test node by name or configuring a distributed node with its listening port and known peers.",
