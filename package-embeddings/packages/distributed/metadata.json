It operates on process identifiers, typed messages (via a parameterized message module), and node configurations to manage communication between local and remote execution contexts. Typical use cases include building fault-tolerant systems requiring cross-node coordination, implementing event-driven architectures with pattern-matched message handling, and managing distributed process lifecycles with guaranteed delivery semantics.",
