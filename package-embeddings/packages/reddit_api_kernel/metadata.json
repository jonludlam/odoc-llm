Together, they facilitate handling Reddit API responses that return lists of user relationships, such as friends or blocked users, in a structured and queryable form.",

It works with JSON values represented as a recursive polymorphic variant type encompassing primitives, arrays, objects, and nested structures, while providing bidirectional converters for OCaml types like lists, options, and tuples. Use cases include API data validation, configuration parsing, and converting between JSON and formats like S-expressions or binary protocols with precise error diagnostics.",
