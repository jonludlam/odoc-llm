Operates on decoder types that track input state and output values, enabling structured data extraction from streams. Used to chain JSON parsing steps, transform parsed values, and combine multiple parser results into tuples.",

Works with decoder types that transform values through chained operations. Used to validate and extract specific fields from JSON or similar formats, applying custom transformations during parsing.",

Supports operations like chaining, tuple aggregation, and field-specific extraction with path tracking. Functions enable parsing JSON by validating required fields, handling optional values, and applying custom transformations. Examples include parsing nested JSON objects, transforming raw input into typed records, and combining multiple parser results into cohesive data structures.",
