It provides operations to create a service, add RPC handlers with associated names, and route incoming HTTP/2 requests to the appropriate RPC based on the request path. A concrete use case is building a gRPC server that dispatches client requests to specific RPC functions registered under their method names.",

It supports constructing and processing finite or infinite sequences with memoized or ephemeral evaluation, including slicing, concatenation, and product operations, while integrating with gRPC streams for bidirectional communication in EIO contexts. Use cases include streaming data pipelines, protocol buffer message aggregation, and implementing server-side streaming logic over RPC connections.",
