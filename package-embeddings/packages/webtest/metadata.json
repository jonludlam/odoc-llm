It supports test setup and teardown with `bracket`, runs tests with `run_one`, and converts synchronous tests to asynchronous with `of_sync`. It works with callbacks, wrappers, and test functions that handle asynchronous execution. Use cases include writing async test cases that require resource management or integration with async libraries.",
