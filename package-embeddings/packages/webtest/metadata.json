Operates on callback, wrapper, and test_fun types to handle asynchronous control flow. Used to execute tests with setup logic, ensure cleanup, and integrate synchronous tests into an async framework.",

It defines test functions that take no arguments and return no value, along with callback and wrapper types for managing async control flow. It enables encapsulating test scenarios with resource management and converting synchronous tests into async-compatible formats. Examples include running a test with setup and cleanup, or integrating a blocking test into an async test suite.",
