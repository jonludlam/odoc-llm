It provides functions to connect to a named pipe server and to convert the connection into a file descriptor for reading and writing. Concrete use cases include inter-process communication between a client application and a local server on Windows systems.",

It works with `t` type instances representing server endpoints, and interacts with clients via file descriptors. Concrete use cases include inter-process communication (IPC) between local applications, such as coordinating background services or streaming data securely between processes on the same machine.",

      "description": "This module enables inter-process communication over Windows Named Pipes using Lwt for asynchronous I/O, supporting both client and server roles. It provides types like `t` for server endpoints and file descriptors for data exchange, with operations to connect clients, accept connections, and transfer data. You can use it to build local servers that stream data securely to connected clients or coordinate communication between background services and applications. Example uses include real-time log aggregation or low-latency coordination between co-located processes.",
