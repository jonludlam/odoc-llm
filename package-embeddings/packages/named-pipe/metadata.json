It provides functions to connect to a named pipe server and to convert the connection into a file descriptor for lower-level operations. Concrete use cases include inter-process communication (IPC) between a client application and a named pipe server on Windows systems.",

It provides operations to wait for a client connection, flush write buffers, disconnect a connected client, and destroy the server. Concrete use cases include inter-process communication on Windows, such as coordinating between a service and its clients or implementing local RPC mechanisms.",
