It supports concurrent access patterns where nodes can be removed, moved, or swapped without traversing the list, and allows lists to act as deques with blocking or non-blocking removal operations. Concrete use cases include building compositional concurrent data structures like LRU caches, where maintaining element ordering and efficient removal is critical.",
