It works with heap-allocated nodes and lists, enabling efficient node manipulation without full-list traversal, strictly serializable composition with other data structures. The transactional submodule extends this with compositional manipulation of nodes within or across lists, supporting blocking and non-blocking value extraction, ideal for thread-safe LRU caches or dynamic collections requiring atomic reordering.
