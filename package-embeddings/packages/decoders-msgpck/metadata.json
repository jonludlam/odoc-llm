      "description": "This module provides a set of combinators for building MessagePack decoders in a pipeline style, allowing field-by-field decoding of structured data. It works with MessagePack values, focusing on extracting and transforming data from decoded inputs using operations like `required`, `optional`, and `custom`. Concrete use cases include decoding JSON-like MessagePack data into OCaml records or custom data types, where each field is processed sequentially and errors are propagated through the pipeline.",

It supports monadic and applicative-style decoding workflows, enabling sequential and parallel data extraction from binary inputs. Concrete use cases include parsing nested MessagePack structures, validating and transforming binary data streams, and decoding complex data formats into OCaml values.",

      "description": "This module combines pipeline-style decoding with compositional operators to process MessagePack data, supporting both sequential field extraction and structured transformations. It provides core operations like `required`, `optional`, and `custom`, along with infix operators for monadic and applicative decoding workflows. Main data types include decoder values that consume MessagePack inputs, enabling use cases such as mapping binary data to OCaml records or validating nested structures. Examples include decoding a MessagePack map into a typed record field-by-field or transforming a binary stream into a validated OCaml value using composed decoders.",

It supports decoding through composable operators and structured transformations, with operations like `required`, `optional`, and `custom`, while encoding handles primitives, collections, and custom types. Data types include decoder and encoder functions that process MessagePack streams, enabling tasks like mapping binary data to OCaml records or serializing OCaml values for transmission. Examples include decoding a MessagePack map into a typed record or converting an OCaml list into a binary MessagePack array.",
