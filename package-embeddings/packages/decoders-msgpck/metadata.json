      "description": "Performs monadic sequencing and transformation of decoder values, enabling composition of parsing steps with context-aware error handling. Operates on decoder types that track input and output states, supporting chaining and combining of parsing operations. Used to build complex parsers by sequentially applying functions to parsed values or combining multiple parsers into tuples.",

Works with decoder types that transform values through chained operations. Used to validate and extract specific fields from JSON or similar formats, applying custom transformations during parsing.",

Supports structured data extraction by defining required and optional fields with path-aware decoding. Combines multiple parsers into tuples or nested structures, enabling custom value transformations during parsing. Examples include parsing JSON objects with nested fields, validating required keys, and applying type conversions during extraction.",

It includes specialized functions for handling nullable values, custom string transformations, and numeric types like int32, int64, and uint64, enabling efficient serialization for data interchange or storage. The `bytes` function specifically targets string encoding, while the generic `encoder` type allows flexible conversion of arbitrary values into the serialized format.",

Provides operations to extract and transform values from input, including handling required and optional fields, and converts values into a serialized `value` type, supporting primitives, lists, options, and objects. Examples include parsing nested JSON-like structures with validation, converting integers and strings to their serialized forms, and encoding custom data types with specific transformations.
