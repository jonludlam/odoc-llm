It supports parsing IP addresses from the beginning of a Cstruct, writing them into Cstruct buffers, and handling conversion errors through result types or exceptions. For example, it can extract an IPv4 address from a packet header or serialize an IPv6 address for network transmission. The main data types are Cstruct.t and the IPv4 and IPv6 address representations.",
