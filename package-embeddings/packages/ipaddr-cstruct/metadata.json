Provides parsing and serialization functions for 4-byte and 16-byte representations of IP addresses. Allows encoding and decoding of IP addresses in binary formats, such as extracting an IPv4 address from a 4-byte buffer or generating a 16-byte Cstruct from an IPv6 address. Supports direct interaction with network protocols requiring raw byte-level handling of IP addresses.",
