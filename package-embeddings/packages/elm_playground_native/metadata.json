It manages global state for rendering contexts and image caching, supporting tasks like dynamic visual content generation, interactive canvas applications, and image processing workflows. Key use cases include building graphical interfaces with real-time input handling, rendering scalable vector graphics, and composing image manipulation pipelines with monadic error handling.",
