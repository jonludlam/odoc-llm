It manages state and rendering contexts through a custom result monad, supporting dynamic content loading, frame-rate control, and robust error handling. The FPS submodule tracks and displays frame rates using mutable state, updating counters and rendering text dynamically during rendering loops. Together, they enable real-time visualizations with performance monitoring and external resource integration.",
