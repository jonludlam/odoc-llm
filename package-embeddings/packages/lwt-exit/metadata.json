      "description": "This module coordinates graceful shutdowns in Lwt-based applications by managing clean-up callbacks, signal handling, and exit procedures. It works with Lwt promises and system signals to enable structured resource release, such as closing network connections or flushing logs, in response to fatal errors or incoming signals. Concrete use cases include registering cleanup actions for resource deallocation, wrapping main application loops to respond to termination signals, and controlling the timing of shutdown sequences with safety timeouts.",
