      "description": "This module coordinates graceful shutdowns by managing clean-up callbacks, signal handling, and exit procedures. It works with Lwt promises, signal setups, and callback identifiers to handle resource deallocation, such as closing connections or flushing logs, in response to signals or explicit exit requests. Concrete use cases include registering callbacks to rollback transactions on exit, wrapping main loops to cancel them during shutdown, and configuring signal handlers to control how interrupts trigger clean-up or immediate termination.",
