It operates on handlers, routes, and rate limiters to enable request filtering, virtual hosting, and structured logging of errors through the `Logs` library. Designed for scenarios requiring API rate limiting, dynamic route matching, and composable middleware stacks with environment-specific logging.",

It supports operations to create headings, links, preformatted text, list items, and quotes, each returning a structured line type that can be rendered to a string or formatted for output. The module works directly with strings and lists of line values, handling line breaks and formatting rules specific to Gemtext.",

It offers core abstractions for constructing and parsing requests and responses, including support for MIME types, streaming payloads, and Gemtext document generation, all without platform-specific dependencies. Its submodules enable network communication over sockets, composable HTTP server logic with routing and rate limiting, static file serving with path safety, and direct file system manipulation for data persistence. For example, a developer can parse a client's HTTP request, route it through a rate-limited middleware stack, generate a structured JSON or Gemtext response, and serve it with correctly inferred MIME types or stream file contents directly from disk.",
