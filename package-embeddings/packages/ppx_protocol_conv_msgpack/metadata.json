It handles error propagation through result types and exceptions, with utilities for converting to and from bytes buffers. Use cases include efficient data interchange in distributed systems, binary data persistence, and interfacing with APIs requiring MessagePack encoding.",

It provides serialization, deserialization, and structured data transformation with robust error handling via result types and exceptions. Child modules extend this functionality with utilities for working directly with bytes buffers and bidirectional mappings for complex OCaml data structures.
