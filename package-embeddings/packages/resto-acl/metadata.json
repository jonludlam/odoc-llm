It provides data types for representing method and path matchers, along with operations to parse, stringify, and evaluate these matchers against incoming requests. For example, it can check if a `GET` request to `/api/users/123` satisfies a rule allowing read access to user resources, or deny access to restricted endpoints based on pattern matching.",
