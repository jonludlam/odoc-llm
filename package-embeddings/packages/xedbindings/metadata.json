It handles disassembly, encoding optimization, and state tracking through abstract pointers and enumerated types. Users can extract instruction details, modify flag states, and analyze operand attributes programmatically. Examples include parsing machine code, optimizing binary instruction sequences, and inspecting register usage patterns.",

It provides structured data types such as `decoded_inst`, `operand_values`, and custom function pointers, enabling tasks like disassembling code, manipulating flags, and converting between enumerated and integer representations. Operations include modifying instruction operands, extracting displacement values, performing bitwise manipulations, and safely accessing foreign memory. Examples include configuring processor states, encoding instructions, and binding C functions for system-level control.",
