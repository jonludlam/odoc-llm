It supports generating integers of various bit-widths, floating-point numbers, and booleans, with operations for bounded range selection and inclusive interval sampling. Child modules offer fine-grained control over PRNG states, enabling creation, copying, serialization, and deserialization to support deterministic simulations and state persistence. Examples include generating repeatable random sequences for testing, restoring generator states mid-simulation, and sampling values within specified ranges for algorithmic use.",
