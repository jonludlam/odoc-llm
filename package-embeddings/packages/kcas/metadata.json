It works with the domain state and memory operations tracked by the STM system. Use cases include selecting an appropriate concurrency strategy for transaction execution based on desired progress properties and performance trade-offs.",

It works with unit values and raises exceptions like `Later` and `Invalid` to control flow in STM transactions. Concrete use cases include retrying a transaction when a `Loc.get_as` returns an unexpected value or when an `Xt.commit` fails due to concurrent modifications.",

It supports composable transactions through explicit log management, enabling actions like swapping values between locations, atomic increments, and validating transaction states, while deferring side effects to `post_commit` for single execution post-successful commit. The module works with transaction logs (`xt`) to track memory accesses, ensuring atomic updates across multiple locations, which is useful for implementing concurrent data structures like doubly-linked lists where shared pointers require coordinated modifications.",

It provides transactional operations through the `Xt` module for coordinating changes to `Loc.t` values, supporting conditionals, swaps, and deferred side effects, with blocking and retry mechanisms for concurrency control. Concrete use cases include building concurrent data structures like linked lists and hash tables where coordinated updates to multiple pointers or values are required.",
