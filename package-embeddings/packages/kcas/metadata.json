      "description": "This module defines the operational behavior of concurrent memory transactions by specifying whether read-only operations should be treated as lock-free or obstruction-free. It directly affects how conflicts between concurrent transactions are resolved, impacting both progress guarantees and performance characteristics. Use `Lock_free` for scenarios requiring guaranteed forward progress across domains and `Obstruction_free` when optimizing for lower overhead in read-heavy, low-contention environments.",

It works with STM transactions and time-based predicates to allow precise control over blocking operations with deadline enforcement. Concrete use cases include implementing time-bounded waits in concurrent data structures and ensuring progress in distributed coordination algorithms.",

      "description": "This module enables transactional manipulation of shared memory locations (`Loc.t`) through composable sequences of reads, writes, and atomic updates (e.g., `get`, `set`, `compare_and_set`), with explicit transaction logs tracking changes. It supports advanced control flow via blocking/nonblocking modes, retries, and timeouts, while ensuring isolation and atomicity by validating and committing changes as a single unit. Typical use cases include concurrent data structures like linked lists or trees where multi-location atomic operations are required, and scenarios needing side-effect deferral until successful transaction completion.",

It works with any value type `'a`, offering fine-grained control over concurrency through non-blocking primitives and optional timeouts or backoff strategies. Concrete use cases include implementing thread-safe counters, concurrent data structures, and coordinating state changes across multiple threads without locks.",

It works with boolean conditions and is used to signal retry or invalidation within transactional contexts. Concrete use cases include conditional synchronization on shared memory states, enforcing transactional constraints, and implementing custom blocking logic based on dynamic conditions.",

      "description": "The library implements a high-performance, lock-free software transactional memory system using an enhanced multi-word compare-and-set algorithm, supporting composable transactions with read-only operations and blocking await capabilities. It provides shared memory locations (`Loc.t`) with atomic updates, transactional reads and writes, and time-controlled blocking on state changes, enabling efficient coordination across concurrent domains. Users can build thread-safe data structures, implement conditional synchronization, and manage time-bounded waits while benefiting from non-blocking progress guarantees and disjoint-access parallelism. Example uses include atomic multi-location updates in concurrent trees, obstruction-free read operations under low contention, and timeout-enforced coordination in distributed algorithms.",
