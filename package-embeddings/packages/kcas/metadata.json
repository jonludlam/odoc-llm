Works with unit type and exception-raising mechanisms. Used to manage retry logic in state transitions or input validation workflows.",

Works with arbitrary data types wrapped in a private `t` type, and supports specialized array allocation for optimized access patterns. Used for concurrent data manipulation in high-performance systems, such as implementing lock-free counters or shared state management in multi-threaded applications.",

It works with `Loc.t` values, enabling safe manipulation of linked data structures like doubly-linked circular lists by composing transactions that update multiple pointers atomically. Use cases include implementing idempotent operations, such as node removal, where changes to interconnected pointers must succeed or fail as a unit without manual retry logic.",
