It provides monadic bind (`>>=`), map (`>|=`), and applicative-style application (`<*>`), along with let- and and- forms for sequential and parallel binding. These operations support building and chaining asynchronous computations that produce values over time, such as handling I/O events or concurrent tasks.",
