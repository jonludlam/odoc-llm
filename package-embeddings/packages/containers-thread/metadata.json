It provides monadic bind (`>>=`), map (`>|=`), and applicative-style application (`<*>`), along with let- and and- forms for sequential and parallel binding. These operations support building and chaining asynchronous computations that produce values over time, such as handling I/O events or concurrent tasks.",

It provides monadic operations like `map` and `bind` for chaining dependent tasks, along with applicative combinators for concurrent execution and callbacks for result handling. The included operator module introduces infix syntax such as `>>=`, `>|=`, and `<*>`, allowing expressive composition of futures using familiar functional patterns. Examples include orchestrating parallel I/O operations, sequencing asynchronous events, and combining multiple futures into a single result.",

Its child module revolves around the `Fut.t` type, enabling the composition of asynchronous computations using monadic operations such as `map`, `bind`, and applicative combinators, with infix operators like `>>=` and `>|=` for fluent expression of sequential and parallel execution flows. Together, they allow orchestrating complex asynchronous workflows, such as running multiple I/O-bound tasks concurrently, chaining dependent computations, and handling results via callbacks. Specific use cases include parallel data fetching, asynchronous event sequencing, and combining futures into coordinated results.",
