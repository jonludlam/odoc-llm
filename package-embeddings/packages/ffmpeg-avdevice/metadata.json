It provides direct access to device lists, format negotiation, and context creation, while its submodules handle device communication and control. The first submodule manages low-level device messages for buffer and state synchronization, such as handling buffer readiness or window resizing. The second submodule sends control commands like `Set_volume`, `Pause`, and `Window_size`, allowing dynamic adjustments to playback and rendering in response to user or system events.",
