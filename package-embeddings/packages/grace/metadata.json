It supports constructing diagnostics with formatted messages, associating them with source locations, and organizing them using severity and priority-based hierarchies. Submodules refine this functionality by enabling message comparison and deduplication, label attachment with source ranges, priority-based grouping, and severity-aware sorting and filtering. Example uses include compiler error reporting with annotated source snippets, diagnostic configuration management, and structured test fixture generation.",
