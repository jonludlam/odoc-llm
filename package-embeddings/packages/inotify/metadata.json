It supports operations to create inotify instances, add or remove watches on file paths, and read event streams with precise event kinds like file modification, creation, or movement. The module works directly with Unix file descriptors, path strings, and structured event types to enable applications such as real-time log monitoring, directory synchronization, or automated testing triggers based on file changes.",
