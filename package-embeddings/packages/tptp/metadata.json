      "description": "This module provides parsing and printing functionality for FOF and CNF formulas in TPTP format, handling lex buffers and abstract syntax trees to read, skip comments, and format output with configurable line wrapping. It supports reading from and writing to TPTP files, including resolving includes and iterating over parsed inputs, with control over number representation and line width. Key data types include formula representations and lex buffers, enabling operations like parsing benchmarks, processing theorem proving problems, and generating readable formula files. Specific use cases involve converting internal formula representations into TPTP output and preparing input files for automated theorem provers.",
