It operates on file descriptors and supports specifying the data type, layout, and dimensions of the mapped region. Use it to work with large files as if they were in-memory arrays, such as for binary data parsing or memory-backed file editing.",

It supports mapping with specified data types, memory layouts, and dimensions, allowing operations like parsing binary files or modifying large datasets in-place. For example, a user can map a binary image file as a 2D array of integers and manipulate pixel data directly. It works on file descriptors, making it suitable for integrating with low-level file handling or streaming applications.",
