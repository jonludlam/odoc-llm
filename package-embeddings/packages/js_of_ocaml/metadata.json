It provides core functions for reading from and writing to JSON buffers and strings, with derived support for types like integers, booleans, lists, arrays, options, and custom algebraic data types. Child modules extend this functionality to specific data types, allowing operations such as converting an OCaml list to a JSON array, parsing a JSON string into a typed variant, or serializing a record with optional fields. Examples include encoding a configuration data structure to JSON for storage, or decoding an API response into a typed OCaml value with guaranteed type fidelity.",
