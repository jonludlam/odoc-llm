Works with strings and byte sequences, ensuring execution time remains independent of input values. Used to securely compare sensitive data such as passwords or cryptographic keys.",

Supports searching for bytes that satisfy a predicate and checking for the existence of such bytes. Designed for low-level byte manipulation in protocols or file formats requiring precise byte-level comparisons.",

It handles strings, bytes, and 32-bit integers, enabling use cases like secure authentication protocols and cryptographic key comparisons where branch-free logic is critical. A key function, `select_a_if_in_range`, facilitates constant-time conditional selections between integers based on range checks, supporting secure decision-making in sensitive computations.",
