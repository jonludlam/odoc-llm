Concrete use cases include caching results of expensive computations, managing limited memory resources, and tracking recently accessed items with automatic eviction based on usage.",

It includes a comparable and hashable key type with invariant enforcement, enabling safe use in hashed and ordered collections, and offers cache implementations that track usage, support statistics, and provide customizable key behavior. You can use it to memoize function results, manage disk reads under memory constraints, or track recent items with automatic eviction. Submodules refine key handling and cache behavior, enabling typed keys, ordered operations, and detailed cache introspection.",
