      "description": "A module providing a polymorphic list structure with constant-time append operations, supporting monadic workflows, custom syntax for cleaner code, and utilities for comparison, serialization, and binary handling. It includes operations like bind, map, and append, along with tools for generating test cases, serializing data, and handling custom types. Users can chain monadic computations, manipulate lists efficiently, and serialize or compare complex data structures. For example, it can build a sequence of words without intermediate allocations, handle nested options with simplified syntax, and serialize custom objects for debugging.",

Supports operations to filter and collect files based on criteria like type, size, and modification time. Can recursively search directories, handle exceptions during access, and return structured results for further processing. Examples include finding all .log files within three levels of a directory or listing files modified in the last 24 hours.",
