It supports checking case properties (e.g., lowercase, uppercase) and offers configurable snake_case generation with optional string cleaning. These functions are useful for tasks like identifier formatting, input normalization, and case consistency validation in text processing workflows.",

These values provide ready-to-use character collections for parsing, validation, and generation tasks. For example, they can be used to check if a string contains only alphanumeric characters or to generate random identifiers.",

It supports direct operations like checking for emptiness, validating numeric formats, and generating strings filled with repeated characters, while integrating submodules for advanced case manipulation, pattern-based repetition, and predefined character sets. Use it to normalize input casing, generate test data with repeated patterns, or validate strings against numeric or alphanumeric character sets. Its combined API enables tasks ranging from simple string checks to complex text formatting and transformation workflows.",
