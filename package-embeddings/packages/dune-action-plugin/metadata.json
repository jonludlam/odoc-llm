It provides functions for merging maps, transforming values, and checking equality, with direct handling of key-value associations and list traversal. Use cases include tracking dependencies with multiple associated actions or configurations, and aggregating results under distinct keys during build or analysis processes.",

It supports higher-order functions such as fold and filter for traversing and refining mappings, particularly useful in dependency resolution and structured data aggregation. The multi-map submodule extends this by allowing multiple values per key, offering methods to append, retrieve, and search across value lists, which is ideal for tracking multiple actions or configurations per dependency. Together, they provide a cohesive toolkit for managing and transforming both singular and plural key-bound data in build systems, configuration pipelines, and analysis workflows.",
