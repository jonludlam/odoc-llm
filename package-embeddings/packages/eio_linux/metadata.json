It manages a fixed buffer allocated at runtime, which may fail under resource constraints. Operations include initializing and managing I/O requests, handling completion events, and controlling execution flow. Examples include submitting read/write operations, monitoring completion queues, and managing buffer sizes dynamically.",

It supports confined and unconfined I/O paths, file references, and dynamic buffer adjustments. Key operations include submitting read/write operations, monitoring completion queues, and managing execution flow.
