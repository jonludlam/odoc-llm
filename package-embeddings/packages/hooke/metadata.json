It works with floating-point values and a snapshot record tracking position and velocity, using parameters like angular frequency and damping ratio to control spring behavior. Concrete use cases include simulating smooth animations, physics-based UI transitions, and dynamic motion control in games or interactive applications.",

It operates on floating-point values and maintains state through a snapshot record, incorporating parameters such as angular frequency and damping ratio to control motion dynamics. It enables tasks like animating smooth UI transitions, modeling physical systems, and implementing responsive game mechanics with precise motion control. Example usage includes calculating spring motion at fixed time intervals or adjusting damping to simulate different material behaviors.",
