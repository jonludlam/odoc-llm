It includes settings for endpoints, headers, batching, threading, and self-tracing, along with a constructor and pretty-printer. It is used to configure how telemetry data is sent to remote endpoints, such as the URL for traces or the interval for background health checks.",

It works with the child module to define and apply detailed export configurations, including endpoints, headers, batching, and threading controls for traces, metrics, and logs. Main data types include configuration records and backend handles, with operations to modify headers, create and apply backends, and adjust export parameters. You can use it to set up a tracing backend with custom headers, control telemetry export intervals, or enable self-tracing for debugging.",
