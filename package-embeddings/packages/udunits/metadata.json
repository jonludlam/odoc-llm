Operates on custom types representing quantities with associated units, ensuring type-safe calculations. Used to standardize physical measurements in scientific applications, such as converting temperature or pressure values across different scales.",

It works with unit systems and individual units, supporting operations like creating converters and formatting units. Use cases include scientific computing, data normalization, and handling complex unit transformations in applications requiring dimensional analysis.",
