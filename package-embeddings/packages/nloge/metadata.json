      "description": "This module provides asynchronous logging capabilities with structured JSON output, allowing logs to be emitted at various severity levels and enriched with contextual data like timestamps and metadata. It supports writing logs to different sinks, such as files or network streams, making it suitable for concurrent Eio-based applications. The severity module defines and manipulates log levels, enabling level-based filtering and consistent representation, while the transform module enriches log entries with dynamic context such as request IDs or thread names before output. Together, these components enable flexible, structured logging pipelines with customizable formatting and routing.",
