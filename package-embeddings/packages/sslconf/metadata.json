It provides operations to create an empty buffer with a specified size limit (`empty`), access the underlying byte buffer (`data`), and safely extend the buffer to a new length (`extend`), ensuring bounds and allocation limits are respected. Concrete use cases include parsing and handling OpenSSL configuration data where controlled buffer growth and memory safety are critical.",

It works directly with `in_channel` and mutable byte buffers to efficiently read and process line-based input. A concrete use case is parsing OpenSSL configuration files where line boundaries and byte-level control are critical for correct interpretation of the file structure.",

Concrete use cases include reading and processing OpenSSL config files for certificate generation or TLS configuration without relying on external tools.",
