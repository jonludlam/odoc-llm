It provides operations to create buffers with configurable maximum sizes, retrieve their underlying byte storage, and dynamically extend their capacity while enforcing strict bounds. The module is used to handle memory buffers in OpenSSL config file parsing where controlled memory growth and predictable initialization are critical.",

It works with standard OCaml input channels and byte buffers, providing the `gets` function to read newline-terminated lines with bounded length. Concrete use cases include reading configuration lines during the parsing of X509 certificate definitions and other OpenSSL config-driven operations.",

It works with strings, sections, and stacks, handling line continuation, comments, value substitution, and quoted or escaped content according to OpenSSL's parsing rules. The module includes a buffer management system for controlled memory allocation and I/O utilities for reading config lines from input channels. It is used to read and process configuration files for tasks like X.509 certificate generation and CA management, where config-driven settings are critical.",
