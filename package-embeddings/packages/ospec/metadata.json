      "description": "Provides functions for parsing and validating OS version strings, extracting major and minor version numbers, and comparing versions numerically. Works with strings representing version identifiers and tuples of integer pairs. Used to enforce compatibility constraints in system-dependent code paths.",

It supports test lifecycle management tasks such as adding hooks, tracking execution states, and inspecting test data structures to facilitate debugging and reporting. Specific use cases include analyzing test outcomes, customizing test execution flows, and maintaining structured test metadata.",

      "description": "Checks if a string matches a regular expression, handles exception raising with custom logic, and executes a function while optionally triggering an exception. Works with strings, exceptions, and functions that return arbitrary values. Used to validate input against patterns, control error propagation, and test exception behavior in specific contexts.",

      "description": "This module offers functions for generating random numeric values, characters, and byte strings with range constraints, as well as creating collections like arrays, lists, and hash tables by iterating generator functions with optional size controls. It operates on numeric types, character sets, byte sequences, and lazy/dynamic data structures, enabling use cases such as testing randomized inputs or simulating data pipelines. Specific applications include generating mock datasets, stress-testing algorithms with varied input sizes, and constructing complex data structures on demand.",

It also includes utilities for constructing and modifying AST nodes, supporting operations like expression sequencing, option handling, and property-based generation. These capabilities are particularly useful for code generation, metaprogramming, or tools requiring precise manipulation of OCaml syntax.",
