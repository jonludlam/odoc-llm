It works with questionnaire and event data types, supporting operations like instantiating questionnaires, answering questions, and modifying templates. Concrete use cases include setting up new questionnaires from templates, recording user responses, and managing questionnaire structure in a MariaDB database.",

It supports working with lists of question-answer pairs and provides functions to convert to and from JSON, compare instances, and construct or update questionnaires. Specific use cases include building and validating structured forms, managing dynamic question sets, and handling user responses with optional fields.",

It provides functions to convert values to and from JSON, pretty-print them, extract text content, compare for equality, and map MIME types to file extensions. Concrete use cases include handling user-submitted answers that may include both text responses and uploaded files with associated metadata.",

It supports operations to validate answers against these constraints, check required status, and modify question properties, working in tandem with answer input types to enforce data integrity. Use cases include dynamic form generation, user input validation pipelines, and structured data collection workflows.",
