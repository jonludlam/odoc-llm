It operates on loggers, sections, and output targets such as files, system logs, and output channels\u2014particularly on Unix and Windows platforms\u2014enabling use cases like platform-specific log aggregation, multi-destination broadcasting, custom formatting, and hierarchical filtering through section-based rules. Key capabilities include defining custom loggers with tailored output behaviors, combining loggers for composite targets, and configuring global logging defaults for application-wide consistency.",
