      "description": "This module provides a flexible logging system that supports asynchronous and synchronous log handling across multiple destinations, with severity levels (debug, info, error) and hierarchical sections for fine-grained control. It allows creating custom loggers with specific output behaviors, combining them using routing combinators to broadcast or filter logs based on section or level. For example, logs can be directed to both a file and the console, with error messages sent to a separate alert system, while dynamically adjusting verbosity for specific sections at runtime. The module's structure enables modular log processing pipelines, integrating context like exceptions or source locations directly into log output.",

It operates on loggers, sections, and format templates, enabling structured message rendering with contextual metadata while handling exception attachments and source tracking. Typical applications include directing logs to platform-specific destinations, filtering by severity/section, and decoupling log production from consumption via Lwt's asynchronous primitives.",
