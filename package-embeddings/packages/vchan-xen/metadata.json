It provides functions to establish connections, read and write data using `Cstruct.t` buffers, and manage connection lifecycle with shutdown and close operations. Concrete use cases include secure, low-level data transfer between virtual machines in a Xen hypervisor environment, such as device emulation or guest-to-host control messaging.",
