It provides functions to establish server and client connections, read and write data buffers, and manage connection lifecycle with shutdown and close operations. The module works with Xen-specific data types such as domain IDs, port identifiers, and Cstruct buffers, and handles errors related to reading, writing, and connection state. Use cases include inter-domain communication in virtualized environments, such as passing network traffic or coordinating state between guest domains and a control domain.",
