It manages encoding state through an environment type that wraps a Jsonm encoder, allowing partial outputs to be buffered while processing heterogeneous values such as primitives, lists, and nullable fields. Typical applications include generating large JSON documents from streaming data sources or building complex hierarchical responses in memory-efficient web services.",

It maintains encoding state through an environment type that wraps a Jsonm encoder, supporting efficient handling of heterogeneous data such as primitives, lists, and nullable fields. Users can assemble large JSON documents from streaming sources or construct complex hierarchical responses in memory-constrained environments. Example uses include generating JSON payloads for web APIs from incremental data or encoding deeply nested configurations with mixed value types.",
