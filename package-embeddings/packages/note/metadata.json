It centers around the `'a event` type, with support for filtering, mapping, and accumulating values, enabling tasks like tracking user input or managing state transitions. The first child module processes paired events, extracting components or merging streams into pairs, ideal for synchronizing parallel inputs like coordinates or dual sensors. The second child module focuses on option events, providing tools to handle presence or absence of values, supporting operations like mapping, binding, and fallback handling for computations that may fail.",
