It provides operations to create, chain, and transform promises, including mapping results, catching errors, and combining multiple promises in parallel or as races. Concrete use cases include managing asynchronous workflows like HTTP requests, file I/O, or event-driven computations where error propagation and composition are critical.",

It works with `Promise.result` values that represent asynchronous computations which may fail. These operators enable concise composition of asynchronous workflows, such as sequentially executing promise-based operations or mapping results without explicit pattern matching.",

It works with any value type `'a` and functions of type `'a -> 'b`, enabling fluent composition of operations. A common use case is chaining asynchronous or pipeline-style computations where each step processes the result of the previous.",

It provides operations to check if there are pending callbacks, take a snapshot of the current state, and invoke all callbacks in the snapshot. The primary data type is a `snapshot`, which holds a group of callbacks to be executed together, ensuring atomicity and consistency during invocation.",

It supports parallel execution with combinators like `race`, `all`, and `allOk`, making it suitable for coordinating HTTP requests, aggregating distributed results, or chaining fallback logic. Submodules provide deprecated infix operators for fluent promise chaining, a threading operator for general function composition, and a callback manager for handling resolution callbacks in atomic batches. Together, these components allow developers to build robust, composable asynchronous workflows with clear error handling and structured concurrency.",
