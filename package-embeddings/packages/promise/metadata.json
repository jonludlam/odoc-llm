It supports creating, chaining, and composing promises using operations like `map`, `flatMap`, and `catch`, along with utilities like `all` and `race` for managing multiple promises. Concrete use cases include handling asynchronous I/O, orchestrating parallel or sequential async workflows, and converting between promise and result types.",

It provides operations to check if there are pending callbacks, take a snapshot of the current state, and invoke all callbacks in a snapshot. The primary data type is a `snapshot`, which captures the list of ready callbacks for batch processing. Use cases include coordinating asynchronous operations in event-driven systems and ensuring timely execution of dependent tasks once a prerequisite completes.",

It works with any value type `'a` and functions `'a -> 'b`, enabling concise data transformation pipelines. Use it to write linear, readable chains of operations by applying functions to values in a left-to-right order.",

It works with first-class computations that produce values, supporting transformations, chaining logic, and combinations of multiple concurrent tasks (e.g., parallel execution, race conditions) through functions like `all`, `race`, and `flatMapSome`. Specific use cases include orchestrating parallel workflows, structuring pipelined data transformations, and managing resolved-value callbacks for integration with external systems.",
