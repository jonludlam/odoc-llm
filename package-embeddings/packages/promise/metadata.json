Works with type `'a result promise`, enabling chaining of functions that transform successful values or propagate errors. Used to handle asynchronous workflows with error handling, such as processing API responses or database queries.",

Works with a parameterized type representing a promise-like structure that can hold a value or an error. Used to manage asynchronous workflows, transform results, handle failures, and synchronize multiple operations.",

It supports chaining, error propagation, value mapping, and synchronization of multiple asynchronous tasks. Functions like `bind`, `map`, and `then` enable sequential processing, while `snapshot` operations allow control over pending callbacks. Examples include handling API responses with error recovery, combining multiple asynchronous results, and managing event-driven callback execution.",
