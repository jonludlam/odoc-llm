      "description": "This module provides infix operators for composing JSON decoding operations, enabling sequential and parallel decoding of structured data. It works with input streams and decoder functions that produce result values wrapped in error types. These operators support use cases like decoding nested JSON objects, validating fields in sequence, and combining multiple decoders for product types.",

      "description": "This module provides combinators for building JSON decoders that extract and transform values from nested JSON objects. It supports operations to decode required and optional fields by key or path, apply custom transformations, and chain decoding steps in a pipeline. These functions are used to construct decoders for structured data types like records and variants from JSON input.",

      "description": "This module enables structured extraction and transformation of JSON data into OCaml values using combinators and monadic operations over `Jsonaf.t`. It supports decoding primitives, collections, and nested structures with field accessors, optional handling, and recursive decoders, allowing users to map complex JSON hierarchies to typed records and handle errors in data ingestion pipelines. Infix operators from the child module enable sequential and parallel composition of decoders, while another child module provides functions to extract and transform values from nested objects by key or path, supporting robust decoder pipelines for structured types. Example uses include parsing JSON from strings, validating and transforming nested fields, and composing decoders for records and variants with precise error handling.",

It supports encoding primitive types like strings, integers, floats, and booleans, as well as structured data such as lists, arrays, and key-value objects. Common use cases include serializing OCaml data structures to JSON strings for API responses or data storage.",

      "description": "This module facilitates bidirectional conversion between OCaml values and JSON data, enabling both structured decoding and encoding operations. It provides core data types like `Jsonaf.t` for representing JSON values, with decoding combinators for extracting and transforming typed data from nested structures, and encoding functions for serializing OCaml primitives and collections into JSON. Users can compose decoders to parse complex JSON inputs into typed records, handle optional and recursive data, and serialize data for API responses or storage. Example workflows include validating JSON payloads from external sources and building typed configurations from JSON files.",
