It maintains zone data in a DNS trie structure and processes incoming DNS packets, managing state transitions for replication from primary servers. Use cases include synchronizing DNS zones from a primary server, responding to AXFR requests, and securely authenticating zone transfer messages with TSIG signatures.",

It processes DNS queries and zone transfers, handles notifications to secondary servers, and manages connections and timers for reliable zone synchronization. Use cases include authoritative DNS hosting, secure dynamic updates, and zone propagation in distributed DNS setups.",

It provides functions to validate access rights for DNS operations like zone transfers, updates, and notifications based on key names and predefined operation mappings. It works with domain names and DNS keys to enforce fine-grained access control policies directly within the DNS trie structure.",

It supports operations to insert, update, or delete records, manage zone delegations, resolve aliases with chain traversal, and compute zone differences or incremental transfers while validating DNS protocol compliance. The structure is designed for applications such as authoritative DNS servers, validating zone configurations, or handling queries that require precise authority checks and alias resolution.",
