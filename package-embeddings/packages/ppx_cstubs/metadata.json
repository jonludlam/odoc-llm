It includes standard operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and bitwise logic, along with left and right bit shifts. These operations are typically used when working with low-level integer types in C bindings or when the signedness of integers is not statically known.",

It provides conversions between `t` and standard types (`int`, `int64`, strings) with hexadecimal formatting, alongside utilities like `succ`, `pred`, and `lognot`. Designed for system-level programming or numerical algorithms requiring precise unsigned integer behavior, it mirrors operations found in systems programming languages while integrating OCaml's type safety.",

It provides infix operators for common operations like `+`, `-`, `land`, `lor`, `lxor`, `lsl`, and `lsr`, each corresponding to a specific low-level operation. These functions are useful for low-level numerical computations and bit-level data manipulation, particularly in systems programming or when interfacing directly with hardware.",

It operates on values abstracted as `t`, which corresponds to C-compatible integer types defined via `Ctypes.typ`, enabling low-level numeric manipulation and interoperation with foreign interfaces. Specific use cases include handling fixed-size integers in system-level programming, interfacing with C libraries requiring precise type alignment, and managing numeric data in formats like hexadecimal strings for serialization or debugging.",
