It provides operations to create and manage SSL sockets, upgrade existing connections, and handle connection lifecycle events. Key functions include creating a client with a specified protocol, upgrading a plain socket to SSL, and shutting down or checking the state of a connection. It works directly with Lwt_ssl.socket and integrates with file descriptors for low-level I/O operations. Common use cases include implementing HTTPS clients and secure WebSocket connections.",

It provides functions to establish, upgrade, and terminate connections, enabling use cases such as HTTP and HTTPS clients, secure messaging, and networked services. The TLS and SSL submodules extend this functionality by implementing secure communication layers, allowing clients to create and manage encrypted sockets, upgrade existing connections, and inspect connection states using protocol-specific APIs. Together, the module and its submodules support building robust, secure, and asynchronous network clients with fine-grained control over I/O and connection lifecycles.",
