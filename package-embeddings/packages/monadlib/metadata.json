      "description": "<think> Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a 2-3 sentence description of the module based on the given summaries. The main points to cover are the main operations, the data structures they work with, and specific use cases. First, looking at the function summaries. The first chunk mentions monadic operations like sequencing, combining, transforming computations within a context 'a m. It also talks about lifting functions for unary, binary, etc., and combinators for binding and filtering. The second chunk focuses on handling optional values, operations like ignoring, filtering, converting lists to options, summing lists of options, combining them, and conditional branching. The data structures here are 'a option and 'a m. Wait, the module is called Option, but the first chunk refers to 'a m. Maybe that's a different monad? But the second chunk clearly mentions 'a option. So perhaps the module provides both monadic operations for a generic 'a m and specific operations for 'a option. But the user said not to repeat the module name, so I need to be careful. The main types of operations: monadic operations (sequencing, combining, transforming), lifting functions, combinators. Also, handling optional values with specific functions like converting lists to options, summing, combining, conditional branching. Data structures: 'a option and 'a m. But maybe the 'a m is part of the monadic context. However, the second chunk specifically mentions 'a option. So the module works with optional values ('a option) and possibly other monadic contexts ('a m). But the user might be referring to the Option module, which typically deals with 'a option. Use cases: handling optional values, avoiding null checks, safely combining computations, processing lists of options (like summing them, converting to options, etc.). Also, conditional branching based on presence of values. So putting it together: The module provides monadic operations for sequencing and transforming computations, including lifting functions and combinators. It works with optional values ('a option) and generic monadic contexts ('a m), enabling safe handling of absent values and list operations. Use cases include safely processing lists of options, conditional branching, and avoiding null references. Wait, but the user said not to use generic phrases. So instead of \"safe handling of absent values,\" maybe specify \"avoiding null checks\" or \"processing optional data.\" Also, the first chunk mentions 'a m, which might be a monad, but the second is about 'a option. So the module might be part of a larger monadic framework, but the main data structure is 'a option. So maybe: The module offers monadic operations for sequencing, transforming, and combining computations, along with lifting functions and combinators. It works with optional values ('a option) and generic monadic contexts ('a m), enabling safe processing of absent data and list operations like summing or converting lists to options. Use cases include handling nullable data, conditional branching, and aggregating results from multiple optional sources. But need to check if 'a m is part of the module. The first chunk's summary says \"context 'a m\" and \"monadic composition\". But the second chunk is about 'a option. So maybe the module is for the Option type, but the first chunk is part of a more general monadic framework. However, the user's module is called Option, so perhaps the 'a m is a typo or refers to 'a option. Alternatively, maybe the module is part of a library that uses 'a m as a monadic type, but the main data structure is 'a option. Alternatively, maybe the first chunk is about a monadic interface, and the second is about the Option type. So the module provides both monadic operations (for 'a m) and specific operations for 'a option. But the user might not want to mention 'a m if it's not the main focus. However, the instructions say to specify the data structures. So need to include both. But the user's module is called Option, so maybe the main data structure is 'a option, and 'a m is part of the monadic operations. So the answer should mention both. So finalizing: The module provides monadic operations for sequencing, transforming, and combining computations, including lifting functions and combinators. It works with optional values ('a option) and generic monadic contexts ('a m), enabling safe handling of absent data and list operations like summing or converting lists to options. Use cases include processing nullable data, conditional branching, and aggregating results from multiple optional sources. But need to make it 2-3 sentences. Maybe combine the first two sentences. Also, avoid \"generic\" if possible. Let me check the original summaries again. First chunk: monadic operations for sequencing, combining, transforming computations within context 'a m. Lifting functions for unary, binary, higher-order. Combinators for binding, sequencing, filtering. Monadic composition and transformation of",
