      "description": "This module combines tagged logic trees with operations for monadic and applicative composition, simplification, and evaluation, enabling symbolic computation and probabilistic reasoning over conditional branches. It supports key data types representing tree nodes with tags and values, and operations like `bind`, `lift2`, `difference`, `maxima`, and `lplus` for combining and pruning trees based on logical constraints. Specific use cases include optimizing logic circuits, propagating constraints, and merging conditional expressions while discarding irrelevant branches during evaluation. Submodules enhance this functionality with lazy combination, filtering via partial orders, and transformations that preserve or extract computational context and tags.",
