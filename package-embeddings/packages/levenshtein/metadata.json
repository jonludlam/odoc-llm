It includes submodules optimized for string comparison, generic array-like structures, and cache-assisted computation, enabling efficient similarity checks for spell checking, DNA analysis, and diff tools. The core functionality works with any element type via provided modules, while specialized variants offer bounded distance calculation, unsafe access for performance, and hash-based caching for repeated use. Examples include comparing strings with `distance`, accelerating large array diffs with `create_cache`, and custom sequence analysis using user-defined equality and accessors.",
