It works with a custom path type to represent file system locations, enabling operations like moving between directories, retrieving file names, and splitting paths into components. Concrete use cases include generating navigation links from directory structures, determining translation URLs for multilingual content, and resolving absolute paths for file access during template rendering.",

It supports creating cached values tied to a key, updating those values on demand or automatically based on dependencies and timeouts, and retrieving them with optional recomputation. Concrete use cases include caching rendered HTML templates or intermediate data structures between runs of a templating pipeline, ensuring efficient regeneration only when dependencies change or cached data expires.",

It allows dynamic content generation by binding functions that compute HTML or strings based on context and arguments. Use it to replace placeholders in HTML with dynamic values or structured content during template rendering.",

It works with HTML documents represented as `Weberizer.html` and bindings defined in `Weberizer.Binding.t`, supporting type-safe template compilation, variable replacement, URL rewriting, and email obfuscation. The path manipulation submodule handles normalization, resolution, and language detection for template sources, enabling navigation link generation and multilingual URL handling. The cache submodule provides persistent storage with dependency tracking and time-based invalidation, ideal for caching rendered templates or intermediate data. The binding submodule manages variable associations, allowing dynamic content insertion through string, HTML fragment, or function bindings that respond to context during rendering.",
