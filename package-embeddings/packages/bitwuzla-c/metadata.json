      "description": "This module provides operations for managing SMT solver configurations, constructing and analyzing logical expressions, and solving constraints through direct bindings to the Bitwuzla C API. It works with solver instances, terms representing logical expressions, and sorts defining data types like bit-vectors, arrays, and floating-points, enabling precise term introspection and manipulation. Typical use cases include building custom SMT-based tools for formal verification, symbolic execution, and constraint solving where low-level control over solver behavior and term construction is required.",
