It supports tasks such as formula assertion, satisfiability checking, model extraction, and handling complex data structures, including array indexing, function definitions, and IEEE 754 floating-point representations. Specific use cases involve verifying bit-vector arithmetic, analyzing floating-point constraints, and managing logical expressions in formal verification workflows.",
