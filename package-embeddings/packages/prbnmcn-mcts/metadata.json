It defines equality and hashing for type t, enabling use in hash tables and sets, and provides monadic operations on 'a t for chaining stateful computations. Users can perform memoized transformations, guide tree exploration with custom comparison logic, and build complex search strategies through composition. Examples include memoizing node expansions, comparing states for equivalence, and combining search paths using monadic binds.",
