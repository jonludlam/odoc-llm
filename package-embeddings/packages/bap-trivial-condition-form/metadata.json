It enables deferred computation through futures and dynamic value resolution, catering to use cases like CLI tool configuration, application settings management, and automated documentation generation from parameter metadata.",

It operates on block, sub, and program terms from the Bap.Std library, introducing new variables to hold intermediate condition values. It is used to simplify control flow structures for analysis or translation tasks.",

      "description": "This module orchestrates a command-line interface for BAP-based tools, managing argument parsing, logging, and progress reporting while integrating structured output through formatters. It processes configuration parameters and command-line inputs into primitive and structured types, supports file path validation, and enables deferred computation for dynamic value resolution. The module simplifies program condition expressions by rewriting them into trivial forms using intermediate variables, aiding control flow analysis and transformation tasks. Example uses include configuring analysis tools via CLI flags, logging progress during program processing, and simplifying complex conditions in BAP projects for further translation or analysis.",
