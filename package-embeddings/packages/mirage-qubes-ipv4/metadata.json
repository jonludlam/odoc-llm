      "description": "This module implements an IPv4 networking layer with support for sending and receiving IP packets, handling protocol demultiplexing for TCP and UDP, and managing IP addresses and routing. It works with IP addresses (Ipaddr.V4.t), prefixes (Ipaddr.V4.Prefix.t), and network buffers (Cstruct.t), and provides functions for checksum computation, packet fragmentation, and source address selection. Concrete use cases include processing incoming IP frames via `input`, transmitting packets with `write`, and configuring or querying IP addresses and prefixes via `get_ip` and `configured_ips`.",

It provides operations for checking address containment within subnets, comparing IP ranges, and validating CIDR notation. Concrete use cases include network access control list (ACL) evaluation, IP filtering in virtualization environments, and subnet membership testing for routing decisions.",
