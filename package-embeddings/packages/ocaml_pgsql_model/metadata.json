Key types include parsed S-expression keys and binary-serializable values, with operations for parsing, validating, serializing, and reconstructing data. For example, it can transform an S-expression string into a strongly typed key or save a custom record to a binary file for later retrieval. It supports both schema-based data loading and high-performance binary storage of complex OCaml values.",
