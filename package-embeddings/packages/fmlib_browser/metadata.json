It works with strings, event decoders, and message types to manipulate attributes like `id`, `class`, `style`, and input-specific properties such as `value` and `placeholder`. These tools are used to build interactive UI components, handle user input changes, and dynamically adjust element appearance or behavior in web applications.",

It works with HTTP requests/responses, random generators, JSON decoders, and time-related data to enable browser-based I/O workflows. Typical use cases include managing AJAX calls with error handling, coordinating animations or timed events, and interacting with browser APIs for focus control or time zone detection.",

It includes functions to extract specific date and time components (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond) when interpreted through a given time zone. Use this module to accurately display or manipulate timestamps in web applications, such as showing the current local time in different time zones or parsing timestamps from external sources for user-facing display.",
