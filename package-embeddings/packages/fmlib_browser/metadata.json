      "description": "This module enables developers to configure DOM elements by setting style properties (e.g., `color`, `font_size`), HTML attributes (e.g., `id`, `class_`), JavaScript properties, and event handlers (e.g., `on_click`, `on_input`), using values of type `'msg Attribute.t` to modify element appearance or bind interactive behaviors. It operates directly on DOM elements, supporting use cases like form validation (via `placeholder`, `value`, and `on_input`), dynamic styling, and user interaction handling. The distinction between string-valued attributes and JavaScript properties ensures precise control over both rendered HTML and runtime element state in browser-based applications.",

It provides four values: `prevent`, `no_prevent`, `stop`, and `no_stop`, which are used to control event behavior in event handlers. These flags are directly used when attaching event listeners to specify how the browser should handle events such as clicks or key presses.",

It utilizes a generic task type that encapsulates success or failure outcomes, supporting advanced workflows such as HTTP communication, time zone detection, and random value generation. Key applications include client-side API interactions, dynamic content updates, and system-aware computations requiring timing or randomness.",

It includes operations to extract date and time components such as year, month, day, and hour when combined with a time zone. The time zone submodule handles conversions using minute-based offsets from UTC, supporting display and transformation of timestamps across geographic regions. Example uses include formatting timestamps in local time, calculating differences between dates, and converting between time zones in web applications.",

It works with message types `'m` and provides functions to map and batch event handlers, decode event data, and trigger messages on specific intervals or animation frames. Concrete use cases include handling user input, reacting to window resizing, tracking mouse movements, and scheduling periodic updates in a web application.",
