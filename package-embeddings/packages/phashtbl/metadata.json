It provides typed interfaces for combinations of string and polymorphic keys and values, supporting operations like open, close, add, replace, remove, and lookup, with strict error handling and iteration capabilities. Concrete use cases include caching large datasets, persisting application state, and managing key-value mappings that exceed memory limits. Submodules specialize in string-only, string-key, generic-key, and generic-key-with-string-value configurations, offering tailored access patterns for different data types and durability needs.",
