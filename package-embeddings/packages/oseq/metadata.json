It operates on values of type `'a OSeq.t`, enabling concise composition of iterator transformations. Concrete use cases include generating integer sequences, chaining iterator operations, and combining multiple iterators into tuples.",

It supports sequencing monadic actions in a lazy stream, folding over elements with monadic effects, and mapping elements into monadic results. Concrete use cases include processing streams of data with side effects, accumulating results in a monadic context, and transforming sequences while preserving monadic behavior.",

It operates on lazy, tail-recursive functional iterators (`OSeq.t`), supporting both finite and infinite sequences, which enables use cases such as data aggregation pipelines, infinite stream processing (e.g., `repeat`, `iterate`), and stateful iterations with side-effectful traversals. Key patterns include indexed folds, interleaving, permutation generation, and integration with I/O or imperative constructs for sequence construction and manipulation.",
