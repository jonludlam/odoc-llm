It provides `return` to wrap a value into an iterator and `>>=` to chain operations that transform elements across sequences. Concrete use cases include composing complex data processing pipelines, such as parsing streams or asynchronous event handlers, where each step depends on the result of the previous.",

It supports operations like mapping, flat mapping, and combining sequences using applicative and monadic syntax. These functions are specifically designed for use with the `OSeq.t` type, allowing for expressive sequence manipulations such as integer range iteration, value transformations, and sequence combination.",

It supports monadic mapping, folding, and sequencing, transforming sequences of monadic values into monadic sequences. It works with `OSeq.t` sequences and a monadic type `M`, enabling use cases like processing streams of results where each element is computed or retrieved monadically, such as reading from a stream with error handling or accumulating state while transforming elements.",

It centers on the `'a t` type, supporting infinite sequences, memoization, and operations like mapping, filtering, zipping, and stateful scanning, while integrating combinatorial and indexed processing. Submodules extend its capabilities with monadic composition, generator-based construction, infix operators for fluent transformations, file I/O for streaming, and monadic traversal for handling effectful sequences. Examples include processing large files line-by-line, generating permutations, building dynamic pipelines with `>>=`, and defining lazy integer ranges with infix syntax.",
