It provides direct utilities for generating constructs from literals and control structures to complex type declarations and functor applications, while integrating submodules for building variant patterns and handling located values with source location metadata. With this module, developers can generate AST fragments for code generation tools, linters, and refactoring utilities, and construct located identifiers and long identifiers for precise AST manipulation during compilation. It is particularly suited for PPX rewriters and compiler extensions requiring fine-grained AST transformations.",
