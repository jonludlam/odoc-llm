It provides functions to read from and write to TCP flows, manage connection shutdown and closure, and access destination addresses, tailored for serving web traffic with automatic TLS configuration. Concrete use cases include deploying secure web servers that automatically obtain and renew Let's Encrypt certificates without manual intervention.",

It provides functions to read/write encrypted data, manage session renegotiation, key updates, and TLS flow lifecycle operations, working directly with `Tls.Config.server`, `Paf.TCP.flow`, and X.509 certificates. Concrete use cases include serving HTTPS content with automatic certificate renewal and handling secure client connections with SNI and mutual TLS options.",

It provides primitives to handle encrypted TLS flows, manage connection lifecycles, and serve HTTPS content with automatic certificate renewal, supporting both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols. Key data types include `Paf.TCP.flow` for network communication and `Tls.Config.server` for TLS configuration, enabling deployment of fully-managed secure web services. Example use cases include building self-contained HTTPS servers that automatically obtain and renew TLS certificates without manual intervention.",
