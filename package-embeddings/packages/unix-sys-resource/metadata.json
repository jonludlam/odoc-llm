      "description": "This module provides direct access to Unix system resource limits through operations like `getrlimit` and `setrlimit`, enabling runtime control over constraints such as maximum open file descriptors and memory usage. It represents limits using the `rlim` type and integrates with the `Sys_resource` module's resource types for precise system configuration. The `host` submodule exposes machine-specific details via `Sys_resource.Resource.Host.t`, allowing retrieval of hostname and IP address information. Together, these components support tasks like tuning network servers for performance or gathering system metadata for monitoring and configuration.",

It provides the `min` function to compute the smaller of two limits, correctly handling comparisons between finite values and infinity. The `to_string` function converts a limit to a human-readable string, useful for logging or display purposes.",

      "description": "This module organizes resource management by combining core resource types like `CORE`, `CPU`, and `NOFILE` with support for defining and converting resource limits. It provides key operations such as `to_string` and `to_code` for mapping resource types to strings and system codes, and works with submodules to handle host-specific configurations and limit representations. The first submodule encapsulates host resource definitions using `of_defns` and `to_defns`, enabling structured configuration workflows, while the second handles resource limits as finite or infinite values with comparison and display functions. Example uses include converting a resource type to a system code for a system call, or computing the minimum of two resource limits when enforcing constraints.",
