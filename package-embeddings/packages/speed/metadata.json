Use it to build structured test hierarchies, run tagged subsets of tests, or define context-specific setup and teardown logic.",

It enables effectful integration tests with pre- and post-conditions, composable stream processing over deferred values, and structured test execution via a root suite reference. Core data types include deferred computations (`D.t`), effectful operations (`Op`), and domain-specific wrappers like `Domain.Sync.t`, with operations to build, chain, and run effectful workflows across synchronous, concurrent, and Lwt-driven contexts. Users can define performance benchmarks comparing sorting algorithms, construct thread-safe data validation pipelines, or compose asynchronous LwtDomain effects into isolated, executable test workflows.",

The module supports chaining and transformation of these results using `bind` and `map`, which handle both success and error cases for seamless validation sequences. For example, you can assert that a function returns an `Ok` value containing a specific integer, then map over that result to perform a subsequent check on a derived string.",
