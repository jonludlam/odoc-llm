The first child module adds infix operators for monadic bind and map, allowing concise composition of deferred filesystem operations, while the second extends this with Lwt-style syntax for sequential binding and transformation using `let*` and `let+`. Together, they support complex workflows like lazily reading and transforming chunk data, chaining metadata updates with file writes, and traversing directory trees asynchronously.",
