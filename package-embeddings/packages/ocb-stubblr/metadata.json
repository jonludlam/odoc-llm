      "description": "This module integrates `Ocb_stubblr` with `topkg` to enable custom `ocamlbuild` command-line arguments and Mirage-specific installation logic. It provides functions to extend build commands with `build_arg`, execute them via `cmd`, and install Mirage-compatible libraries using `mirage`, which handles `.clib` files with optional Xen and filesystem variants. Concrete use cases include configuring `myocamlbuild.ml` to support `Ocb_stubblr` during package builds and installing Mirage libraries with multi-arch support.",

      "description": "This module enhances OCamlbuild with specialized handling for C stubs and libraries, introducing tags like `link_stubs`, `pkg-config`, and multi-lib support to manage compilation and linking with custom options. It works directly with `.clib` files, header dependencies, and OCaml archives, enabling precise control over C library integration in projects. Concrete use cases include building OCaml primitives with embedded C code, cross-compiling for MirageOS targets, and resolving external C dependencies via `pkg-config` during the build process.",
