It operates on ANSI-compliant terminals and Windows shells, using style codes and cursor state management to enable dynamic output formatting. Specific use cases include building interactive command-line interfaces, real-time terminal visualizations, and tools requiring precise control over text rendering and cursor behavior in supported environments.",
