Its core functionality works with integer-based file offsets and integrates with host-specific definitions to map seek operations to system call codes. The child module facilitates conversion between abstract and host-specific representations using `of_defns` and `to_defns`, enabling seamless interaction with low-level system calls like `lseek` and `sendfile`. Together, they support implementing custom I/O layers and system utilities requiring fine-grained control over file positions.",

It works with child modules that convert between structured representations and host-specific system configuration constants, such as `Unistd.Sysconf.defns`, enabling serialization and inspection of configuration data. You can use `pagesize` directly for low-level memory management or system interface implementations, while the child modules allow converting system configuration definitions to structured forms for storage or transmission. Together, they support inspecting, serializing, and using system configuration data based on the host's properties.",

It maps between integer bitmask representations and typed structures, allowing precise control over permission settings during file operations or creation. The child module translates host-specific access rules into structured data, supporting programmatic validation and transformation of access control configurations. Together, they enable tasks like verifying file accessibility before I/O, constructing custom permission masks, or converting system-specific access policies into typed, manageable forms.",
