It provides functions to send IRC commands like JOIN, PRIVMSG, and PONG, and to react to incoming messages, enabling use cases such as IRC bots or persistent chat clients. The network submodule manages socket communication, supporting IPv4 and IPv6 to establish and maintain real-time connections. Together, they allow building robust IRC clients that can send messages, join channels, and handle server interactions seamlessly.",
