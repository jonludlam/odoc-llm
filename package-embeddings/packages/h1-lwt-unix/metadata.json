It provides data types for requests, responses, and streaming bodies, along with operations to send requests, handle incoming connections, and process headers and body data incrementally. You can use it to build custom HTTP clients that stream large payloads or implement servers that support protocol upgrades like WebSockets. Specific use cases include sending chunked HTTP requests with Lwt-driven I/O and handling server-side requests with per-connection error management.",
