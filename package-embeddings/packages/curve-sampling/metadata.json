It generates discrete representations of continuous curves over a given interval and handles discontinuities via `Cut`. Concrete use cases include rendering smooth curves in vector graphics and discretizing mathematical functions for plotting.",

      "description": "This module performs adaptive sampling of 2D curves, supporting parametric and explicit functions, and produces piecewise-linear approximations as lists or sequences of points grouped into connected components. It allows constructing samplings from functions or sequences, applying transformations and clipping, and exporting to formats suitable for plotting tools like Gnuplot or TikZ. The child module extends this by sampling parametric curves using `Gg.p2` points, supporting adaptive and uniform strategies, and handling discontinuities via `Cut`, enabling smooth rendering and discretization of complex curves. Example uses include visualizing mathematical functions, generating vector graphics, and clipping curves to specific regions for efficient rendering.",
