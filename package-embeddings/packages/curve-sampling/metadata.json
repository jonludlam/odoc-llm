Enables uniform sampling of parametric curves, conversion between list and sequence representations, and handling of piecewise curves with defined cuts. Operations include curve segmentation, point interpolation, and transformation between data structures. Example tasks include sampling a sine wave, splitting a curve at specified intervals, and converting a list of points into a lazy sequence.",
