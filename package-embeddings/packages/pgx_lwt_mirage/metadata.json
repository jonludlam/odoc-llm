Operates on types such as IP addresses, Cstruct.t for packet data, and custom error types. Used to establish and manage UDP connections, process incoming traffic, and send packets with controlled network parameters.",

It works with network flows, IP addresses, and ports, enabling reliable communication in networked applications. While a type `t` is defined, its specific role remains unclear, suggesting potential for future expansion in connection state handling.",

Handles IP layer operations such as demultiplexing incoming packets, sending data with configurable options, and generating pseudoheaders for checksums. Works with IP addresses, prefixes, and connection state, enabling tasks like packet routing and network interface configuration.",
