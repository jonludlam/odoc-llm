It introduces an abstract type `t` for immutable path representations, supporting structural equivalence checks, component-based transformations, and hierarchical navigation through operations like joining, renaming, and extracting root or drive details. Submodules extend this functionality with structured ancestry traversal, allowing indexed access, iteration, folding, and membership checks over sequences of parent paths, enabling tasks like directory navigation, path validation, and hierarchical transformations. Concrete use cases include cross-platform file utility development, configuration path management, symbolic path analysis in build systems, and safe directory traversal with ancestry checks.",
