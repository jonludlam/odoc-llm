      "description": "The module provides a typed interface for constructing semantic and structural HTML elements, including headers, forms, and inline components, with specialized handling of attributes where some accumulate (like class) and others override. It supports both void elements (e.g., meta, script) and container elements (e.g., div, nav), enabling precise control over document structure and content through tag-specific constructors and child node composition. This facilitates tasks like creating dynamic web interfaces and ensuring consistent HTML formatting with semantic clarity.",

It defines a core data type for HTML nodes, with operations for composing children, setting attributes, and rendering elements. Users can create dynamic interfaces by combining elements like headers, forms, and scripts, while maintaining control over class names and other attributes. Examples include generating responsive layouts, embedding scripts conditionally, and constructing form elements with validated input fields.",
