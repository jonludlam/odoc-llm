It provides core data types for S-expressions (`t`), positions, ranges, and parser states, along with operations for parsing from strings, files, and buffers, pretty-printing, and structural manipulation. You can track source locations during parsing for precise error reporting, preserve comments and formatting when rewriting configuration files, or debug incremental parser states during complex input processing. Submodules enhance functionality with detailed positional tracking, annotated parsing, and layout-aware rendering, enabling tools like linters, formatters, and DSL interpreters.",
