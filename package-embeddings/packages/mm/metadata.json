      "description": "This module processes and manipulates audio data using buffers, format conversion, and signal modification. It supports operations such as resampling, noise generation, channel management, and real-time effects like amplification and panning. Key data types include interleaved float arrays and packed sample formats such as U8, S16LE, and S32LE, with utilities for handling PCM data and performing RMS analysis. You can synthesize waveforms, normalize audio levels, buffer data between threads, and convert between float32 bigarrays and internal audio structures for low-level processing.",
