      "description": "This module defines syntactic operators for transforming and combining sinks. It provides `let+` for mapping a function over a sink's result and `and+` for zipping two sinks into one that produces a pair. These operations work with any sink that consumes values of a given type and produces a result, enabling concise composition of data consumers that aggregate values incrementally. Use cases include building complex data processors from simpler sinks, such as collecting stream elements into multiple structures simultaneously or deriving derived metrics from a single pass over the data.",

It works with the `Stream.t` type to enable incremental processing of sequential data. Use `yield` to emit individual values and `let*` to flatten stream pipelines, such as transforming lines read from standard input before outputting them.",

It operates on sinks that process input values and produce a result of a specific type. A concrete use case is adapting the output of a sink that sums integers into one that converts the sum to a string, without changing how the summing logic consumes input.",

It works with sinks that hold values or functions, allowing the result of one sink to be used to influence another in a structured, applicative way. Concrete use cases include composing sinks that parse or aggregate structured data, such as combining separate sinks for reading JSON fields into a single structured value.",

      "description": "This module processes streams by consuming values and building results from incremental state, supporting early termination and resource management. It offers core operations like `zip`, `seq`, and `map` to compose stateful consumers in parallel or sequence, with built-in sinks for aggregation into arrays, buffers, or arithmetic summaries. The `let+` and `and+` operators enable concise syntactic composition, while applicative combinators allow structured combination of incremental values. Examples include collecting stream elements into multiple containers, computing derived metrics, or writing to files incrementally with guaranteed resource cleanup.",

      "description": "This module enables incremental, push-based processing of sequences through composable streams that guarantee resource safety, even with early termination or exceptions. It supports creating streams from sources, transforming them with flows, and consuming them with sinks, while providing direct operations like `map`, `filter`, and `concat` for stream manipulation. The `yield` function emits single-element streams, and `let*` enables chaining transformations, allowing workflows like reading lines from input, processing them, and printing results incrementally. Example usage includes building pipelines that stream file contents, process log lines in real-time, or handle interactive input without buffering.",

It works with streams by intercepting internal folding functions to modify data flow without handling input or output directly. Concrete use cases include filtering elements with a predicate, mapping values to a new type, buffering fixed-size chunks, and composing multiple processing steps into a single flow.",

It works with sources backed by lists, arrays, strings, queues, or custom state machines, supporting finite and infinite streams through lazy evaluation. These sources are ideal for resource-safe processing of large datasets, real-time data pipelines, or deterministic input consumption where explicit state management and cleanup are required.",

It centers around streams as push-based sequences, flows as element-wise transformations, and sinks as stateful consumers, enabling operations like `map`, `filter`, `zip`, and `fold` to process data in constant space. The `let*` and `let+` operators support fluent composition of transformations and aggregations, while sources from lists, files, or custom state enable flexible input. Examples include streaming log files line by line, filtering and aggregating values in real-time, or writing processed data to multiple outputs concurrently with guaranteed resource cleanup.",
