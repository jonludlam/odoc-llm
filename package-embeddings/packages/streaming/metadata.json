      "description": "This module provides `pure` and `<*>` operations to apply functions within a sink context, enabling the combination of multiple sinks into a single sink that processes values in parallel. It works with sinks that consume values of a common input type and produce structured results by applying functions incrementally as data flows in. Concrete use cases include aggregating data from multiple sources simultaneously, such as computing the sum and product of a stream in one pass, or validating and transforming stream elements using applicative-style composition.",

These operations enable declarative sink composition for data processing pipelines, such as aggregating multiple statistics from a stream of log entries.",

It works with the `Stream.t` type to enable building and chaining streams using familiar syntax. Use `yield` to inject values into a stream and `let*` to sequence stream transformations, such as processing lines read from standard input before printing them.",

It operates on sinks that process input values and produce a result, allowing the result type to be changed while preserving the input type. A concrete use case is adapting a sink that counts elements into one that returns a string representation of the count.",

It handles resource-sensitive operations through sinks that encapsulate stateful processing and guarantee cleanup, working with diverse data types including bytes, strings, and numerical streams. Typical applications include parsing network data, incremental file processing, and composing parallel reductions in data pipelines while maintaining constant memory usage.",

It works with sources backed by lists, arrays, strings, sequences, and imperative queues, offering combinators for mapping, filtering, zipping, slicing, and folding, along with explicit disposal of internal state. Typical use cases include processing large datasets, building decoupled producer-consumer pipelines, and implementing resource-safe streaming workflows where elements are generated or consumed incrementally without memory bloat.",
