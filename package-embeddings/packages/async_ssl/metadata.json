      "library": "async_ssl",
      "description": "This library provides low-level SSL/TLS integration with OpenSSL for asynchronous OCaml applications, enabling secure communication with fine-grained control over protocol versions, encryption, and certificate handling. Core data types include `t` for protocol versions, `Verify_mode.t` for certificate validation policies, and `Dh.t` for Diffie-Hellman parameters, while operations span secure socket initialization, handshake management, and cryptographic configuration. You can implement TLS clients and servers with custom cipher suites, enforce protocol constraints like TLS 1.2 or higher, perform certificate verification, and generate or use standard DH groups for key exchange. Specific uses include building HTTPS clients with certificate pinning, testing secure communication resilience, and configuring servers with restricted TLS versions and cryptographic settings.",
