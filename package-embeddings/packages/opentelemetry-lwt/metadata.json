Works with span and scope types from the Opentelemetry module, using key-value attributes and trace identifiers. Used to instrument code for distributed tracing, ensuring spans are correctly nested and attributed within an ambient execution context.",

Works with timestamp types, attribute lists, and OpenTelemetry protocol buffers for metric data. Used to track real-time system performance, aggregate user behavior metrics, and generate detailed statistical distributions for monitoring.",

It works with types like `log_record`, `logs_data`, and `log_record_flags`, enabling structured telemetry data handling and instrumentation. Use cases include logging instrumentation, distributed tracing integration, and formatted log entry generation for observability pipelines.",
