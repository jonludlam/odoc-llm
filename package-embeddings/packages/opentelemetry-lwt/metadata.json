It works with span and scope data structures, allowing for scoped tracing contexts with trace and span IDs. Concrete use cases include instrumenting asynchronous applications to collect trace data for observability, adding events and attributes to active spans, and managing trace propagation across service boundaries.",

It operates on hierarchical log data structures\u2014including individual records, scoped log groups, and resource-level collections\u2014while supporting both Protocol Buffers encoding and human-readable formatting. Typical use cases involve instrumenting distributed systems to generate correlated logs for observability platforms or exporting telemetry data to OpenTelemetry-compatible backends.",

It handles data types like float, int, and histogram data points, with support for attributes, timestamps, and exemplars. Concrete use cases include tracking request latencies with histograms, counting events over time with sum metrics, and exposing current values via gauges for real-time monitoring.",
