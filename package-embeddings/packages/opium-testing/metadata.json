Each function directly supports asserting equality and generating readable diffs in unit tests for Opium-based web applications. It enables precise validation of HTTP components during test execution without requiring manual string or structure comparison.",

      "description": "This module simplifies testing Opium web applications by providing functions to simulate HTTP requests and validate responses directly using Alcotest. It includes operations like `handle_request` to invoke routes and assertions such as `check_status`, `check_meth`, and `check_body` to verify response properties. The core types `Request.t`, `Response.t`, `Status.t`, and `Body.t` are used throughout to ensure consistency with Opium's runtime behavior. Submodule utilities enhance test precision by enabling direct comparison and readable diffs of HTTP components like headers, cookies, and methods during test execution.",
