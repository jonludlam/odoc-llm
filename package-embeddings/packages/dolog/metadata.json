It operates on log messages tagged with levels like `ERROR` or `DEBUG`, allowing dynamic control over message prefixes, output destinations, and color mappings for enhanced readability in environments like interactive terminals or log aggregation systems. Specific capabilities include conditional message rendering based on severity thresholds and programmatic customization of visual log presentation.",

It supports filtering messages by severity, directing output to different destinations, and configuring visual presentation for terminals or log systems. You can set thresholds to control which messages appear, define custom prefixes, and adjust colors for different log levels. For example, you can log an error with `ERROR` level that appears in red only when the threshold is set to include errors.",
