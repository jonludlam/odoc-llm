It works with types like `t` for client configuration, `User.t` for authenticated user data, and error types for handling API failures such as token expiration or rate limiting. Concrete use cases include redirecting users to Spotify for login, exchanging authorization codes for tokens, refreshing expired tokens, and making authenticated API requests to access user-specific data like playlists or listening history.",
