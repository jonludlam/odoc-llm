It supports a generic 'a t structure, allowing for the construction of typed regular expressions that can match and extract structured data. Operations like <|>, <&>, *>, and <* facilitate building expressive parsing logic, while the module integrates with Tyre's bidirectional regular expressions for routing and pattern matching. Examples include parsing URL routes by combining segments or extracting nested data from text.",
