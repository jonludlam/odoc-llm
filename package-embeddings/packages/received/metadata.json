It supports structured values for addresses, protocols, timestamps, and message identifiers, with extensible string-based fields for custom routing or protocols. The `Encodes` submodule serializes these structures into properly formatted email headers or logs, while `Decodes` parses raw header strings into typed values using Angstrom, extracting timestamps and server metadata. Use it to validate message paths, analyze email delivery chains, or trace routing through servers.",
