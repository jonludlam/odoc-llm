It exposes abstract time values and operations to retrieve the current time or sleep for a given duration, often used in network services and system tasks. The sleep operation, provided by its child module, allows delaying execution in nanosecond intervals, returning a promise that resolves after the specified delay. You can use it to implement timed retries, rate limiting, or coordinated delays in concurrent operations.",
