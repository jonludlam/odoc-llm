It supports operations like `mem` to check existence, `find` to retrieve values, and `add` or `unsafe_add` to store values with auto-generated or explicit keys. It is used to persist and retrieve versioned data directly in Git's `.git/objects` format, ensuring content integrity through hashing.",

It works directly with Git data structures like blobs, trees, commits, and references, supporting operations such as hash-based storage, reference validation, and branch management. Concrete use cases include building versioned data stores with Git semantics, performing atomic updates on tracked references, and managing in-memory Git repositories for lightweight or partial clone workflows.",
