It supports structural manipulation through merging, filtering, and partitioning, while maintaining key order for predictable iteration and range-based queries. Use cases include processing Unicode character properties, constructing custom code point groupings, and analyzing sequences of encoded characters.",

      "description": "This library decodes Unicode character database information from XML and provides access to properties like normalization forms, case mappings, bidirectional classes, and East Asian width. It exposes a unified type for querying boolean, enumerated, and string-valued properties of Unicode code points, supporting tasks like text normalization, script detection, and case conversion. The child module enhances code point handling by implementing ordered maps for efficient storage, transformation, and traversal of custom data associated with Unicode characters. Together, they enable structured analysis and processing of Unicode text, including custom property mapping and range-based queries.",
