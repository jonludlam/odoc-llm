It works with mappings from Unicode code points (`Uucd.cp`) to arbitrary values, supporting efficient traversal, filtering, and structural manipulation while preserving key ordering. This is particularly useful for Unicode data processing tasks requiring precise handling of code point ranges, such as encoding conversion, character property assignment, or text analysis workflows.",

      "description": "This module decodes Unicode XML data into structured representations for querying character properties, including case handling, decomposition, normalization, script classifications, and East Asian encoding variants. It operates on Unicode code points (`Uucd.cp`) and exposes properties as boolean flags, enumerated types, or string-valued metadata (e.g., `Uucd.prop`), leveraging the `Cpmap` module for code point range mappings. Typical applications include text processing pipelines requiring bidirectional layout analysis, Indic script rendering, East Asian character encoding conversion, and validation of Unicode identifiers or normalization forms.",
