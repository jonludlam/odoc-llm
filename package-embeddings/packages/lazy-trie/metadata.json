Works with immutable tree structures where nodes are evaluated on demand. Used to implement efficient, memory-conscious string-based indexing in applications like autocompletion and routing tables.",

Works with tuples of key-value pairs and lazy lists of child nodes, enabling efficient path-based access and modification. Supports setting and retrieving values along paths, pruning branches, and grafting subtries, useful for implementing configuration hierarchies or symbolic expression parsing.",
