It allows overriding specific mapping behaviors through inheritance and method overrides, enabling transformations like code refactoring, linting, or syntax extension. Concrete use cases include custom PPX rewriters and AST analysis tools tailored to the 4.09 compiler version.",

      "description": "This module provides utilities to build and manipulate OCaml 4.10 ASTs, focusing on expressions, patterns, and core types like literals, tuples, records, lists, and variants, with support for location tracking, attributes, and transformations. It includes submodules for handling function argument labels and unified constant representations across OCaml versions, enabling precise AST construction and analysis. You can generate function calls with labelled or optional arguments, convert between constant types seamlessly, and build tools like linters or refactoring utilities that work reliably across OCaml versions. Direct APIs let you construct AST nodes while submodules handle label and constant variations, ensuring compatibility and correctness.",

      "description": "This module provides utilities for constructing and inspecting OCaml AST nodes specific to version 4.09, including expressions, patterns, and type constructors, with support for location and attribute metadata. It enables precise AST manipulation through direct operations like building let-bindings or function applications and analyzing type information, while its child modules handle constants and argument labels with cross-version compatibility. For example, you can create a labeled function argument, convert a string literal between AST versions, or extract expressions from attributes to support code generation and static analysis workflows. The combination of node-level constructors and helper modules streamlines tasks ranging from AST traversal to syntax extension development.",
