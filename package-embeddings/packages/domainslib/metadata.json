It provides operations to set up and tear down domain pools, run tasks synchronously or asynchronously, and perform parallel computations such as for-loops, reductions, scans, and searches over integer ranges or arrays. These functions are used to distribute compute-intensive workloads like numerical simulations, bulk data processing, or search algorithms across multiple domains efficiently.",
