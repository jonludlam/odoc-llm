It provides operations to convert values to strings, compare them, serialize to dynamic values, and interact with environment variables for socket address configuration. The first child module resolves file system locations for Dune RPC using environment mappings and build directory paths, enabling the retrieval or construction of socket file locations. The second child module specializes in resolving Dune RPC socket file locations at runtime using environment variables and file system paths, facilitating communication endpoint setup during builds.",
