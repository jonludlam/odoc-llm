Works with `('a, Fs9p_error.t) Result.result Lwt.t`, allowing functions to chain operations that handle both errors and concurrency. Useful for writing clean, error-resilient asynchronous workflows without explicit pattern matching at each step.",

It processes incoming requests on a network flow, routes them to the appropriate VFS directory, and manages connection lifecycle until closure.

      "description": "This module implements a 9p protocol server that exposes a virtual file system directory over a network or local channel, enabling remote clients to perform standard file operations like read, write, and stat. It provides a functor that integrates with custom VFS implementations, allowing seamless mapping of file operations between the network and the virtual directory tree. The server handles connection lifecycle management, request routing, and protocol encoding, making it suitable for embedding a sandboxed file system in a networked service or exposing it over a Unix domain socket. Specific use cases include serving a virtualized directory structure to remote 9p clients or implementing custom file system semantics over a network channel.",

      "description": "This module provides tools for handling and transforming errors in 9P protocol operations, including conversions between error types and the creation of structured error responses with optional codes. It includes a custom bind operator for asynchronous result values, enabling clean composition of Lwt-based functions that return `Result.result` values. The core operations support mapping `Vfs.Error.t` to `Fs9p_error.t`, generating formatted errors, and chaining asynchronous computations with error propagation. For example, it allows writing pipelines that perform file access or message parsing while handling failures through typed errors and composing them seamlessly with Lwt promises.",
