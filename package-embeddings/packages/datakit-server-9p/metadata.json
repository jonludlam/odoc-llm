Supports reading data into a buffer, writing single or multiple buffers, and closing the flow gracefully. Operates on Lwt-based asynchronous I/O, buffers represented as Cstruct.t, and flow objects abstracting network connections.",

Operates on Lwt-promise wrapped Result types, where failures are preserved through the chain.
