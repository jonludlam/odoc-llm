It operates on data types representing wires, registers, and clocked processes, enabling circuit specification in a structural and behavioral style. Concrete use cases include FPGA design entry, ASIC simulation, and hardware verification workflows.",

      "description": "This module offers a comprehensive suite of array manipulation operations for a custom polymorphic array type, emphasizing performance-critical scenarios. It supports functional transformations (indexed mapping, filtering, folding with early termination), in-place mutations (swapping, reversing, filling), and efficient data interchange (conversion to lists, serialization). Key use cases include numerical computations requiring precise memory control, algorithmic implementations needing indexed traversal or matrix operations, and systems where unsafe optimizations or uninitialized memory handling are justified. The design bridges functional purity with imperative efficiency through dual variants of operations like `map` vs `map_inplace` and safe/unsafe accessors.",

      "description": "This module provides utilities for string manipulation and working with optional values, offering functions to concatenate strings with separators and apply operations to pairs of options. It integrates array handling capabilities through its child module, which delivers high-performance operations on polymorphic arrays, including transformations, mutations, and conversions. Main data types include strings, options, and a custom array type, with operations like `concat`, `map2`, and array mapping or swapping variants. Examples include building formatted output from string parts, safely combining optional values, and performing efficient in-place array computations.",
