It operates on float and integer values, with parameters tailored to each distribution (e.g., mean, shape, scale) and supports features like tail probabilities, log scales, and non-centrality parameters. Use cases include statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and numerical analysis, enabling tasks like probability calculations, random variate generation, and advanced mathematical computations.",
