It supports decoding audio into floating-point or integer sample formats, with options for mono or stereo output, and allows sequential access to stream metadata like comments and headers. Concrete use cases include playing back Speex-encoded audio files, processing live Speex streams from network sources, or extracting metadata from Speex-encoded content.",

It supports decoding audio into floating-point or integer formats, handles mono and stereo output, and allows sequential access to metadata such as comments and headers. You can use it to play Speex files, process live network streams, or extract metadata from encoded audio. For example, you can open a Speex file, decode its contents into audio samples, and retrieve artist or title information from the stream.",

It integrates with child modules that handle Ogg-based serialization, skeleton packet generation, decoder and encoder setup, and high-level decoding from files or streams. The `Speex.Header.t` type stores codec settings, while functions interact with `Ogg.Stream.packet` for structured audio transport, enabling use cases like streaming with adaptive bitrate or compressing voice data for VoIP. Examples include constructing Ogg files with fisbone packets, decoding live audio into sample arrays, and extracting metadata from encoded streams.",
