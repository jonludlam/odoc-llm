      "description": "This module handles symbolic identifiers and their class hierarchies, providing structured representations for literal variables and classes. It supports operations such as string conversion, lexicographic comparison, and equality checks, with specific support for distinguishing base and derived literal classes. You can use it to manage unique identifiers in logic systems, enforce class relationships, and maintain consistent ordering during parsing or symbolic manipulation. For example, it enables tracking variable names in a solver while ensuring correct inheritance and comparison behavior across literal types.",

Its Boltzmann submodule enables combinatorial structure generation using weighted distributions derived from symbolic generating functions, such as random trees or graphs with controlled size distributions. Core data types include polynomials and symbolic expressions, supporting algebraic operations like addition, multiplication, and differentiation, along with combinatorial constructions like sequences and sets. Examples include randomized testing, data fuzzing, and probabilistic simulations using both basic sampling and symbolic methods for structured random generation.",

It supports field-like arithmetic, polynomial operations, Boltzmann sampling, and algebraic transformations, enabling precise numeric conversions, symbolic differentiation, and random generation of structured data. Users can evaluate transcendental functions, solve combinatorial systems via Newton iteration, build weighted combinatorial classes, and generate random terms like trees or sequences with controlled size and shape. Specific applications include financial modeling, symbolic math, combinatorial analysis, and fuzz testing with structured random inputs.",
