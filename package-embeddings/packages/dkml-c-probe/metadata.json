It works with a hidden internal type `t` that represents a collection of these flags. Concrete use cases include extracting `-I` paths for header includes, `-L` paths for linking, and `-l` library names to construct compiler or linker command lines.",

It works with abstracted flag types that represent C compiler and `ocamlmklib` tool configurations, enabling extraction and construction of command-line arguments tailored to specific toolchains. Concrete use cases include retrieving GCC or MSVC-specific flags for linking OCaml with cross-compiled C libraries like GMP, ensuring correct linkage during Dune-based builds.",
