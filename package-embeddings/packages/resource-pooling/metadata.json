It specifies operations for connecting to and closing connections with individual servers, checking server health at regular intervals, and handling failures by isolating faulty servers and rerouting requests. Concrete use cases include load balancing across a cluster of database servers or HTTP endpoints while automatically isolating and recovering from server outages.",

It supports adding, removing, and checking server statuses, with automatic suspension and reactivation of servers based on health checks. Concrete use cases include load balancing database or API connections across a cluster of backend servers, ensuring fault tolerance and connection efficiency.",

It works with generic resource types, allowing configuration of maximum size, validation checks, and cleanup logic. Concrete use cases include pooling database connections or HTTP clients to avoid the overhead of repeated initialization, ensuring efficient reuse and controlled resource consumption.",

The main operations include `use` for executing actions on available connections, automatic server suspension on failure, and periodic `check_server` health checks to reactivate suspended servers. Data types represent servers, their connection pools, and health states, supporting actions like adding or removing servers, handling connection lifecycles, and routing requests away from failed nodes. Example usage includes load-balancing database queries or API requests across a cluster while isolating and recovering from outages.",
