It operates on persistent vectors that support operations like mapping, folding, and concatenation, while providing reversible conversions between lists, arrays, and sequences. This design suits scenarios requiring high-performance immutable sequence handling, such as algorithmic implementations where structural sharing and logarithmic time complexity for updates are critical.",
