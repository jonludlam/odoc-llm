It provides functions to read images from files or memory buffers in various formats (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit float) and write images to PNG, JPEG, HDR, and general image file formats. Use cases include loading textures for graphics applications, saving processed images, and handling image data in memory for further manipulation or analysis.",

It includes functions for reading and writing images in multiple formats via the `Stb` and `Magick` submodules, handling raw pixel data in memory-mapped files through `Data_unix`, and creating disk-backed images for efficient processing with `Image_unix`. Concrete use cases include loading and saving images for graphics pipelines, batch conversion of image files, and direct manipulation of large image datasets in scientific or visualization applications.",
