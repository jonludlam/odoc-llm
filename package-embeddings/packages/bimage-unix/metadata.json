It provides functions to read images from files or memory buffers in various pixel formats (8-bit integer, 16-bit integer, 32-bit float) and to write images to disk in PNG, JPEG, and HDR formats. It directly works with `Bimage.Image.t` structures, supporting typed image data with specific color spaces and pixel types. Use cases include loading textures for graphics applications, processing image files in scientific workflows, and exporting computed image data to standard formats.",
