It provides operations for reading and writing images in common formats, converting between color spaces, and accessing raw pixel data through typed structures. Users can process images via command-line tools or direct memory access, adjusting quality, format, and pixel representation as needed. Examples include converting a raw disk image to a PNG, adjusting JPEG compression, or extracting specific color channels from an HDR file.",
