It uses `t` for client states, `Cstruct.t list` for data transfers, and `int64` for sector addressing, enabling precise read and write operations. It supports exporting local storage with access controls and ensures proper session termination. Examples include reading from a specific sector of a remote disk or writing data to a block device after connection setup.",
