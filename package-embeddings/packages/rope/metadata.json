It works with the `t` type for buffers and produces `Rope.rope` values for immutable string-like structures. Use this module to construct large text bodies incrementally, such as log files, document editors, or network message buffers, where performance and memory efficiency matter.",

It provides the `printer` function for formatting rope values, along with mutable settings `max_display_length` and `ellipsis` to control display behavior. Useful when inspecting large ropes in the REPL, ensuring readable and manageable output without fully expanding very long strings.",

It supports operations to move the current position incrementally or directly, retrieve characters at or near the current position, and obtain the underlying rope. Concrete use cases include parsing large text buffers, implementing text editors, or scanning through massive strings where repeated indexing would be inefficient.",

It offers utilities for case transformation, whitespace trimming, substring searching, and index-based character queries while maintaining performance for multi-megabyte texts. Designed for applications requiring scalable text handling\u2014such as implementing edit buffers, processing log files, or managing email payloads\u2014it integrates with OCaml's I/O systems and optimizes memory usage through structural balancing techniques.",
