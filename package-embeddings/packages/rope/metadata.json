It supports operations like `get`, `incr`, `decr`, `goto`, and `move` to navigate and retrieve characters at specific positions in O(1) or amortized O(1) time. It is particularly useful for applications like text editors or parsers that require frequent sequential or localized access to large ropes.",

It works with the `t` type representing mutable rope buffers, allowing dynamic growth and efficient in-place modifications. Concrete use cases include constructing large text documents incrementally, handling I/O from channels into ropes, and managing substrings without full copies.",

It provides the `printer` function for formatting rope values, along with mutable references `max_display_length` and `ellipsis` to customize display behavior. Useful when interactively working with large ropes to avoid overwhelming the console with excessive output.",

It supports key operations like `concat2` for fast joins and `sub` for efficient slicing, with optional indexed access via `Rope.Iterator` for amortized O(1) character traversal. The `Rope.Buffer` submodule enables incremental construction of ropes through mutable buffers, supporting appends of characters, strings, and channels. In the OCaml REPL, the `Rope.top` module customizes rope display, limiting output length for readability during interactive sessions.",
