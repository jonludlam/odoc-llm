It includes submodules that handle VLQ encoding with Base64 characters to and from `Buffer.t` and `char Stream.t`, enabling compact, ASCII-friendly representations. Main operations allow reading and writing integers in VLQ format, with specific applications in source map generation and binary serialization. Examples include encoding a sequence of integers into a Base64 VLQ string or decoding such a stream into original integer values.",
