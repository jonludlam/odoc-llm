It enables tasks such as zipping multiple non-empty lists into tuples, applying functions across corresponding elements, and sequencing transformations while guaranteeing list lengths remain consistent. The child module offers no additional functionality, leaving the focus solely on the core interface for working with length-constrained, non-empty list structures.",

It ensures that operations like parsing or validation maintain at least one result while accumulating multiple outcomes. Submodules extend this capability with additional combinators, though one submodule is currently empty and unused. Example uses include parsing pipelines that guarantee a result and validation steps that collect multiple errors across inputs.",
