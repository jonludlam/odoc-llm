It provides functions to inspect message properties such as whether it was starred, privately sent, or directed at the current user, and allows constructing replies based on message context. Concrete use cases include filtering messages by recipient type, generating sender mentions, and sending targeted replies in event-driven bots or real-time messaging applications.",
