It defines a type `t` with mutable fields and indexed elements, supporting operations like value alteration, property extraction, and configuration updates. Users can fine-tune color intensities, filter data based on component values, or apply transformations in pipeline workflows. For example, it can normalize color values or isolate specific components for further processing.",
