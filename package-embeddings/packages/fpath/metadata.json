      "description": "This module offers set operations for ordered collections of `path` values, including addition, removal, combination, and element-wise transformations like mapping and filtering, alongside traversal and inspection methods. It supports safe and unsafe retrieval of specific elements, list-to-set conversions, and debugging utilities such as formatting and dumping. Use cases include managing hierarchical path data, efficient element querying, and structured data manipulation in systems requiring ordered set semantics.",

It works with maps where keys can be paths or generic types and values are either single elements or lists, enabling structured data handling. Use cases include safe retrieval of hierarchical data, dynamic configuration management, and efficient traversal of nested key-value relationships.",

It supports ordered set manipulations, such as adding, filtering, and transforming path collections, as well as key-based map operations for managing path or generic key-value pairs with flexible value structures. Users can perform efficient lookups, merges, and traversals, enabling tasks like configuration management and hierarchical data organization. Examples include filtering a set of paths by extension or building a map of directory paths to their contents.",
