It enables tasks like path collection analysis, membership checks, and transformation through mapping and filtering, working entirely with `Fpath.set` structures without interacting with the file system. Use cases include managing include/exclude path lists, combining directory hierarchies, and deduplicating file paths from sequences.",

It operates on path representations using `Fpath.t`, alongside set and map abstractions for managing path collections. Designed for cross-platform path handling, relativizing paths, and maintaining consistent path invariants without direct file system interaction.",
