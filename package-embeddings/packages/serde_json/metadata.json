It operates on a stateful parser context that maintains position and error information, enabling precise validation and error recovery during JSON stream processing for tasks like deserialization or schema enforcement.",

      "description": "This module handles the low-level parsing and validation of JSON data from strings, supporting all core JSON elements such as primitives (booleans, numbers, null), objects, arrays, and structural tokens. It maintains a stateful parser context to track position and errors, enabling accurate parsing and recovery during JSON stream processing. Operations include consuming tokens, skipping whitespace or arbitrary characters, and validating structure, making it suitable for tasks like deserialization and schema validation. Example uses include extracting values from a JSON string, verifying JSON structure before parsing, and streaming large JSON inputs with error resilience.",

Processes JSON records and fields through visitor patterns, enabling structured decoding of nested data structures and robust error handling in scenarios like API response parsing or configuration file interpretation.",

It supports serializing OCaml types such as options, lists, tuples, and custom records through functions like `serialize_record` and `serialize_field`, which handle structured field-by-field encoding. Typical use cases include generating compact or human-readable JSON for APIs, configuration files, or data interchange where precise control over serialization is required.",

It provides core operations for parsing JSON from strings, validating structure, and mapping JSON elements to OCaml types like records, variants, and sequences using visitor-based decoding. Serialization builds JSON output from primitives and structured data, writing directly to streams or strings with configurable formatting. Examples include parsing API responses into typed OCaml structures, validating JSON before processing, and serializing application state to JSON for storage or transmission.",
