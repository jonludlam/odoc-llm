      "description": "The module offers low-level parsing functions for extracting primitive data types (booleans, integers, floats, strings) and structural elements (brackets, commas, colons) from a stream, alongside utilities for skipping whitespace or arbitrary characters. It operates on a stateful `t` type, managing sequential consumption of input with error handling via a result type. This is particularly useful for building custom parsers for structured data formats or lexing tasks requiring fine-grained control over input processing.",

It supports operations like reading booleans, numbers, strings, and navigating through brackets, commas, and colons. Functions allow skipping whitespace or specific characters, enabling precise control over input processing. This is ideal for constructing custom parsers or lexers that require detailed handling of structured data formats.",

It handles structured data through format-specific handlers, enabling tasks such as data persistence or network transmission. While the `kind` and `state` types define internal processing modes, the primary use cases revolve around converting heterogeneous data into serializable forms.",

It operates on state records and type parameters, enabling flexible processing of validated fields or ignored unknown data. Specific use cases include parsing nested data structures, transforming parsed values, and ensuring robustness against unexpected input formats.",
