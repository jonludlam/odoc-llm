      "description": "This component offers low-level JSON parsing capabilities that process character streams from a `lexbuf`, extracting primitives like booleans, numbers, and strings while validating structural elements (colons, commas, brackets). It operates on a parser state (`t`) combined with `yojson` lexer state, managing input consumption and syntax validation through functions like `skip_space` and `read_colon`. Typical applications include incremental token parsing, JSON syntax checking, and error-resilient stream processing with explicit `result`-typed outcomes for robust error handling.",

      "description": "This module supports deserialization of JSON objects into OCaml records and algebraic data types, handling primitives (integers, strings, booleans), sequences, variants, and nested structures through a stateful parser that tracks context transitions. It operates on JSON ASTs using a visitor pattern to extract and validate structured fields, keys, and values with size constraints. Typical use cases include mapping JSON configurations to typed OCaml models, decoding API responses with optional or recursive data, and robust parsing of heterogeneous JSON inputs with contextual error reporting.",

It operates on a mutable `state` that manages formatting and output, using a writer interface for streaming JSON, and supports error handling through result-returning functions. Specific use cases include incremental JSON generation for large datasets and robust serialization of complex data structures with nested fields or polymorphic variants.",
