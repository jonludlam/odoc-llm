It works with a structured type `t` that includes JOSE algorithms, JWK keys, and optional header parameters, along with standard JSON values for serialization. Concrete use cases include preparing headers for JWT tokens, JWS signatures, and JWE encryption operations by encoding key identifiers, algorithms, and content metadata.",
