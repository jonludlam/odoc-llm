It enables extraction of metadata such as key type (kty), key ID (kid), and algorithm details, along with thumbprint computation and use-value conversions, ensuring safety checks for symmetric keys during verification workflows. These capabilities support use cases like secure authentication, signature verification, and key management in cryptographic protocols.",
