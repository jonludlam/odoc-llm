It works directly with `Cstruct.t` buffers for memory-efficient splitting and processing of binary data, such as network packets. Use cases include network monitoring, packet analysis, and systems requiring direct interaction with raw packet buffers or platform-specific capture mechanisms.",

It operates on raw network interfaces and works with `Cstruct.t` buffers for packet data. Concrete use cases include crafting and injecting custom Ethernet frames, implementing DHCP clients or servers, and capturing specific network traffic such as filtering and responding to DHCP requests.",
