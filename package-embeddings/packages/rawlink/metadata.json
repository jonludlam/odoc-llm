It processes packet data using `Cstruct.t` buffers and Unix file descriptors, supporting both AF_PACKET and BPF backends. These operations are critical for low-level packet capture, network monitoring, and protocol analysis in systems requiring direct hardware access or custom traffic filtering.",

It supports reading and sending raw Ethernet frames via `read_packet` and `send_packet`, and includes helpers to generate BPF filters for DHCP traffic. Use cases include crafting custom network protocols, implementing DHCP clients or servers, and monitoring or injecting raw network traffic.",
