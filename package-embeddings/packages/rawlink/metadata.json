Operates on interface names and Cstruct.t buffers to handle full Ethernet frames. Used for capturing or injecting packets with specific filters, such as DHCP traffic on ports 67 and 68.",

It supports byte-level transformations of `Cstruct` data into lists, facilitating packet segmentation and protocol-specific data processing. These capabilities are essential for network monitoring, packet analysis, and custom data parsing workflows.",
