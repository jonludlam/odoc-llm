It works with any type `'a` and binary functions of type `'a -> 'a -> 'a`, validating correctness conditions for operations like addition, multiplication, or custom combinators. Concrete use cases include verifying mathematical laws for custom data types, testing function correctness in property-based testing, and ensuring consistency of operations in algebraic structures.",
