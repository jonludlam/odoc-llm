It works with any type `'a` and binary functions of type `'a -> 'a -> 'a`, enabling validation of mathematical laws for operations such as addition, multiplication, or custom operators. Concrete use cases include verifying correctness of arithmetic operators, testing algebraic structures like monoids or semigroups, and ensuring consistency of custom comparison or combination functions.",
