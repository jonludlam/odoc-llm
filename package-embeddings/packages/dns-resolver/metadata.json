It processes DNS messages using functions like `handle_buf` to parse incoming responses and generate outgoing queries or answers, and uses `query_root` to initiate root zone updates. The resolver maintains internal state (`t`) that tracks pending queries, cached responses, and configuration parameters such as IP protocol version and cache size.",

It handles DNS queries, IP addresses, and TLS settings to enable external DNS resolution in MirageOS unikernels.

Example use cases include resolving domain names over DNS over TLS on a non-standard port or caching DNS responses to improve performance in networked unikernels.",
