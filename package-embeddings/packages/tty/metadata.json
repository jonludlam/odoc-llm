It operates on basic integer and unit types to manipulate terminal state through low-level commands. Concrete use cases include building text-based user interfaces, implementing custom progress displays, or managing terminal output in interactive applications.",

It provides setup and shutdown functions to configure stdin for asynchronous reading using Unix terminal IO settings. Useful for interactive command-line applications needing immediate input response without blocking execution.",

It works directly with terminal display state and cursor coordinates to enable dynamic text rendering and interactive command-line interfaces. Specific use cases include building terminal emulators, text-based user interfaces, and applications requiring precise screen updates or enhanced terminal interactivity.",

Works with `Tty.Color.t` values, transforming them based on the loaded profile. Useful for ensuring consistent color output across different terminal environments by adapting color representations dynamically.",

It provides functions to construct and inspect color values, as well as convert them into escape sequences for foreground or background display. Use cases include styling terminal output with specific color codes and handling color input from configuration strings.",

It works with color values, terminal state, and input streams to support tasks like styled output rendering, cursor positioning, screen buffer management, and real-time input processing. Concrete use cases include developing interactive command-line tools, text-based interfaces, terminal emulators, and applications requiring precise control over terminal display and input behavior.",
