It can be used to model virtual file systems in memory, such as for testing or building custom storage abstractions.",

It associates values with metadata such as modification time and size, enabling modeling of virtual file systems for testing or custom storage abstractions. Operations include reading, writing, listing, and deleting keys with precise control over content and metadata. Submodules extend functionality for specific use cases, such as time-based snapshots or layered storage views.",
