It works with any point type that satisfies a given distance metric, supporting operations to build the tree, find the closest point to a query, and convert the tree back to a list. The point module defines the metric space interface, including the distance function `dist`, enabling spatial partitioning and similarity searches over high-dimensional data. Example uses include spatial queries, clustering algorithms, and efficient similarity search in large datasets.",
