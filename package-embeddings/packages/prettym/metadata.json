It provides `sub` for extracting byte ranges and `weight` to measure the size of a buffer. Useful for low-level data processing tasks like parsing binary formats or managing network payloads.",

It integrates buffer and IO vector operations for efficient rendering of human-readable output, such as code or structured data, with support for customizable separators and hierarchical layout combinators. Child modules provide low-level buffer manipulation, including offset tracking, slicing, and size calculation across various buffer types like `Bigstring`, `String`, and `Bytes`, enabling efficient handling of network data, file I/O, and binary parsing. Together, they allow both high-level document composition and fine-grained data processing, from serializing complex values to managing raw byte segments.",
