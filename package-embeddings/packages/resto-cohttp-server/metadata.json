It works with typed directories mapping paths to services, leveraging Lwt promises and higher-order combinators to enable type-safe, composable routing for Cohttp servers. Typical use cases include building RESTful APIs with nested routes, merging versioned endpoints, or handling dynamic subdirectories that extract parameters from URLs.",
