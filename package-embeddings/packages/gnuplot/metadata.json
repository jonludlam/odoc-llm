It supports operations on color tuples, time intervals, fill configurations, output parameters, label structures, and data sets, enabling tasks like creating gradient-filled plots, defining time-based visualizations, and generating labeled charts. Functions allow for blending colors, validating time overlaps, applying hatch patterns, setting output formats, adding labels, and plotting financial or time-series data. Examples include generating candlestick charts with OHLC data, configuring plot fills with HSL colors, and exporting visualizations in PNG or EPS formats.",
