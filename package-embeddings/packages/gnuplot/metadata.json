It provides functions to convert color values to their corresponding string representations for use in Gnuplot commands. Concrete use cases include specifying plot line colors or surface color schemes in generated Gnuplot scripts.",

It works with floating-point numbers, date, time, and timezone types to set precise bounds for X, Y, or combined XY axes, as well as date and time ranges. Use this module to constrain plots to specific numerical or temporal regions, such as limiting a graph to a particular date range or zooming into a subset of data points.",

It handles histograms via value distributions and candlestick charts using OHLC (open-high-low-close) data with temporal indexing, supporting both timezone-aware timestamps and calendar dates. These operations cater to financial analysis, statistical reporting, and time-dependent data visualization where customizable aesthetics like color and line weight enhance interpretability.",

It supports key data types such as ranges for axis constraints, fill styles for shaded regions, labeled points for annotations, and output configurations for rendering destinations. Operations include setting titles and grid options, defining series with time-series or numerical data, applying colors to lines or surfaces, and exporting plots in formats like PNG or EPS. Specific tasks include generating histograms with pattern fills, plotting financial candlestick charts with OHLC data, and rendering time-based scatter plots with custom fonts and dimensions.",
