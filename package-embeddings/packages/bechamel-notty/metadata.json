Works with a custom type `t` and a hash table mapping string labels to order configurations. Supports comparing values based on predefined orders or labels, useful for sorting or ranking data in specific sequences.",

Supports unit conversion, value comparison based on order configurations, and display of regression results with labeled fields and sorted outputs. Operations include adding units, defining order sequences, and rendering structured statistical summaries. Examples include displaying coefficient tables, ranking variables by significance, and converting unit labels to string representations.",
