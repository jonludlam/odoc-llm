      "description": "This component offers a hash table implementation for managing polymorphic key-value pairs with keys of type `G.V.t`, supporting imperative operations like insertion, lookup, iteration, and bulk updates from sequences. It is designed to efficiently track node metadata (e.g., positions or attributes) in layered tree structures, where horizontal node placement depends on depth. Typical use cases include caching traversal results, mapping nodes to computed coordinates, or storing dynamic properties during layout algorithms.",

It calculates node positions using a specified distance function between vertices and outputs the layout in a map structure associating each node with its position. It is used to visualize hierarchical data with fixed horizontal spacing per depth level, such as organizational charts or directory structures.",

It provides equality and hashing functions for comparing and identifying nodes based on their keys. This module is used to construct and manipulate hierarchical tree layouts where node positioning depends on depth rather than subtree height.",

It produces positioned output in a structure `H`, suitable for rendering or further processing, with node positions determined by depth. The module includes a hash table implementation for managing polymorphic key-value pairs keyed on `G.V.t`, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of node metadata such as positions or attributes during layout computation. This combination supports operations like caching traversal results, mapping nodes to coordinates, and applying bulk updates from sequences to track dynamic properties in layered tree layouts.",

It works with hash tables (`'a H.t`) and sequences (`Stdlib.Seq.t`), enabling efficient insertion, replacement, and iteration over collections of vertex-associated values. These operations are particularly useful for tracking dynamic attributes of nodes in layered tree layouts, such as positional offsets or rendering metadata, where bulk updates or lookups are required during layout computation.",
