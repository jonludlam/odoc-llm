      "description": "This module provides imperative hash table operations for tracking node positions and attributes during layered tree layout computation. It manipulates key-value stores where keys are graph vertices (`G.V.t`) and values represent polymorphic layout data such as coordinates or dimensions. These operations enable efficient aggregation of positional constraints, in-place updates for dynamic tree adjustments, and bulk initialization from sequences of precomputed node attributes.",

It works with graph structures where nodes are identified by `G.V.t` and edges are implicitly defined through the tree structure. The `layout` function calculates positions using a provided distance function between nodes, making it suitable for rendering trees in visualizations where consistent horizontal spacing per layer is required.",
