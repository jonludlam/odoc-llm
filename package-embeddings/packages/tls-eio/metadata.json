It supports loading certificates from individual files or entire directories, and constructs authenticators for certificate validation using trusted CAs, fingerprints, or CRLs. Concrete use cases include configuring TLS servers with certificate chains and private keys, validating client certificates against trusted authorities, and building certificate-based authentication systems.",

It works with Eio's two-way flows and TLS configuration types, handling secure state transitions and cryptographic operations. Concrete use cases include establishing encrypted client-server connections, enforcing certificate authentication, and managing TLS 1.3 key exchanges.",
