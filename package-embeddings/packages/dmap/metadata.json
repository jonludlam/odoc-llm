It works with elements of a `DORDERED` type, leveraging their total ordering for efficient membership checks, ordered traversal, and transformations like filtering or mapping. Use cases include maintaining sorted collections, performing range queries via ordered iteration, and converting between sets and sequences for structured data processing.",

It works with heterogeneous map keys that have a total order and supports operations like comparison of extended keys. Concrete use cases include building layered indexing structures where each key layer adds contextual data to the original ordered key.",

It enables ordered traversal, merging of maps, and transformations like filtering or partitioning based on key ranges, with utilities to convert bindings to and from sequences or lists. Such functionality is suited for applications requiring strict key ordering, such as database indexing, priority-based data management, or ordered collection processing with heterogeneous value types.",

It works with heterogeneous maps where keys are ordered and values have types dependent on their keys. A concrete use case is building dictionaries with keys derived from existing ordered types, such as mapping integer ranges to different value types using a key transformation function.",

It provides operations for combining maps through union or merge, filtering based on predicates, transforming elements via ordered traversal, and safely accessing bindings with optional results, all while preserving immutability through balanced binary tree structures. Such maps are ideal for scenarios like managing dynamic configurations with type-safe values, processing ordered event streams, or handling persistent state transformations where key ordering and type-dependent data coexist.",

It works with any module `X` that conforms to the `DORDERED` signature, allowing heterogeneous values to be compared consistently. Use this module to create ordered collections or perform comparisons on values that may have different types but share a common ordering relation.",

It supports operations like merging, filtering, partitioning, and ordered iteration, with logarithmic time complexity for insertion and lookup, while leveraging physical equality to optimize immutability. Typical applications include managing configurations or aggregating data with key-dependent types, such as symbolic computation environments where keys determine associated value semantics.",
