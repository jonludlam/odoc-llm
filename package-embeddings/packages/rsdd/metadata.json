      "description": "This module provides operations for constructing and manipulating Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) through logical operations (AND, OR, ITE, negation), structural queries (node variables, low/high branches), and probabilistic reasoning tasks like weighted model counting and expected utility computation. It works with BDDs, CNF formulas (e.g., parsed from DIMACS), and parameter records to enable symbolic reasoning in applications such as combinatorial optimization, probabilistic inference, and decision-theoretic problem solving. Key workflows include compiling CNF constraints into BDDs and solving utility maximization problems using branch-and-bound or model enumeration techniques.",
