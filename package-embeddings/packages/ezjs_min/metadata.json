It supports creating tables, adding and removing entries, and extracting keys or items. Use cases include mapping string identifiers to values, aggregating data for JavaScript interop, and building dynamic object structures.",

      "description": "This module provides operations for working with optional values in a way that interoperates with JavaScript's `null` and `undefined` semantics. It supports a custom `t` type that wraps optional values, offering functions like `some`, `null`, `undefined`, and `coerce` to construct and extract values, along with `map`, `bind`, and `case` for transformation and branching. Concrete use cases include handling optional return values from JavaScript APIs, safely chaining operations on potentially missing data, and converting between OCaml `option` types and JavaScript-style optional values.",

It works with JavaScript promise objects and associated error types, allowing integration with JS APIs. Concrete use cases include handling asynchronous operations such as DOM events, network requests, or timers directly from OCaml code.",

It operates on arbitrary values and string literals, formatting them into log outputs for runtime monitoring. Typical use cases include debugging complex workflows, tracking errors with contextual parameters, and emitting structured diagnostic information during application execution.",

It works directly with JavaScript's `bigInt` type, enabling precise handling of arbitrarily large integers in OCaml code compiled to JavaScript. Concrete use cases include financial calculations, cryptographic operations, and any domain requiring exact integer representation beyond the limits of standard integer types.",

It supports key-value tables, optional semantics, big integers, arrays, and objects, providing essential tools for integrating OCaml codebases with JavaScript environments such as web applications or Node.js services. Core functionalities include safe value transformation, debugging utilities, and direct construction of JavaScript-native entities like regular expressions, dates, and error objects.",

It works with Lwt threads and JavaScript promise-like structures, ensuring type-safe transformations and handling optional values and diverse callback signatures. Typical use cases involve integrating JavaScript APIs returning promises with Lwt-based OCaml code or combining asynchronous workflows from both ecosystems seamlessly.",

It operates on abstract JavaScript values, optional/undefined types, and OCaml data structures, enabling use cases such as marshaling JSON between OCaml and JavaScript, handling browser APIs with promise chains, and safely coercing types across language boundaries. Specific patterns include error propagation from JS exceptions, functional transformations of optional values, and runtime type checks for safe interoperation.",
