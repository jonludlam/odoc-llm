Works with custom types `t`, `encoder`, and `decoder` to handle data serialization and deserialization. Used to configure and manage data flow in network protocols requiring byte-level control and TLS awareness.",

Operates on send and receive types that encapsulate data transmission channels. Used to process data streams in scenarios where TLS is not required, such as plain text communication or testing environments.",
