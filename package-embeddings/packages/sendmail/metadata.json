It works with `encoder` and `decoder` types to manage encrypted SMTP message streams, supporting operations like initiating TLS sessions, sending/receiving data, and closing connections. Concrete use cases include securing email transmission channels and implementing authenticated SMTP relays.",

      "description": "This module enables secure email transmission by implementing SMTP client functionality with STARTTLS support, handling domain validation, authentication, and TLS encryption. It provides core data types such as `encoder`, `decoder`, and error types for managing secure SMTP transactions, with operations for initiating TLS sessions, sending and receiving encrypted data, and handling temporary delivery errors. Submodules handle protocol negotiation, TLS context management, plaintext email encoding, and error handling, supporting use cases like authenticated SMTP relays and secure message transfer over upgraded connections. Specific examples include initializing TLS sessions with custom encoder/decoder pairs, inspecting TLS state during transmission, and sending raw email data over plaintext or encrypted channels.",
