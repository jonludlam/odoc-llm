      "description": "The module offers operations for list manipulation, including element access, transformation via mapping and filtering, structural modifications through concatenation and reversal, and advanced processing with folds and indexed iterations. It works with polymorphic lists and supports operations on sequences, key-value pairs, and dual-list structures, often allowing custom predicates or comparison functions. These tools are suited for tasks like data traversal, aggregation with accumulators, sorting merged sequences, and conditional element extraction in functional pipelines.",

It operates on string-based regular expressions and annotated syntax trees with location data. Concrete use cases include validating and transforming pattern-matching logic in OCaml code during preprocessing.",

      "description": "This module processes regular expressions by parsing them into structured ASTs, transforming patterns into executable OCaml code, and managing variable bindings extracted from match groups. It supports case analysis, group wrapping, and position tracking, enabling extensions to pattern matching and automated code generation for regex-based parsers. Submodule 1 enhances list processing capabilities with polymorphic operations like mapping, filtering, and indexed traversal, useful for manipulating sequences and key-value structures during data aggregation or transformation. Submodule 2 focuses on parsing, validating, and re-rendering regular expressions, providing tools to inspect and modify pattern logic during compilation, such as extracting binding information or converting regex syntax trees back into strings.",
