      "description": "This module provides functions to transform stringable data structures into fzf-compatible pickable inputs. It supports mapping over string-keyed maps, selecting from associative lists, and directly using lists of stringable values. Concrete use cases include building interactive CLI menus from string-based enums, selecting configuration options from stringable records, or filtering user inputs from a list of string-represented entities.",

      "description": "This module provides an interface for selecting from various input sources using fzf, transforming selections into meaningful outputs through mappings or shell commands. It supports input types like maps, association lists, string lists, and dynamic command outputs, enabling use cases such as choosing configuration values from a map or filtering paths via shell pipelines. The child module handles conversion of stringable data structures into fzf-compatible inputs, allowing interactive menu construction and list filtering. Together, they enable rich, dynamic selection workflows driven by both static data and runtime computations.",

Works with non-empty lists of strings for key definitions and uses a once-set value to store the detected key. Useful for implementing custom key bindings in interactive terminal menus driven by fzf.",

It maintains an internal mapping of selectable items, allowing efficient lookup of user selections by their displayed string representation. Use cases include building dynamic, searchable UI components in terminal applications where input arrives incrementally, such as log viewers or live search interfaces.",

It supports selecting between sorting by line length, position of the match (beginning or end), or input order. These strategies are applied directly during fzf execution to influence result ranking.",

Works directly with lists of values, returning optional results based on user input. Useful for command-line tools that require user-driven filtering or choice, such as selecting files, processes, or configuration options.",

It supports input transformation via mappings, shell commands, and dynamic sources, while handling key detection, stream processing, and tie-breaking strategies for precise selection behavior. Users can build searchable interfaces from static or streaming data, implement custom key bindings, and control result ranking based on line length or match position. Specific use cases include interactive configuration menus, live log filtering, and fuzzy path selection with custom sorting.",
