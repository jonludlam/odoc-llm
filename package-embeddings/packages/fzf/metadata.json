It supports operations like `map`, `assoc`, and `inputs` to transform maps, association lists, and string lists into interactive fzf inputs. Concrete use cases include building command-line interfaces where users select from dynamic lists of options, such as choosing a file from a list or picking a configuration value.",

Works with non-empty lists of strings for key definitions and uses a mutable set to track pressed keys. Useful for implementing custom key-based navigation or selection logic in fzf-driven terminal UIs.",

It directly handles user interaction with the terminal, returning selected values once the user confirms their choice.

It supports transformations where user selections from displayed strings map to corresponding values of arbitrary type. Concrete use cases include interactive CLI tools for tasks like choosing a configuration entry from a map, selecting a file from a dynamically generated list, or streaming log entries for real-time filtering.",

It supports dynamic updates and collision resolution policies when adding new items to the selection set. Use cases include building live-updating UIs for selecting from large or infinite data sources like log streams or search results.",

It works with string input and supports four tiebreak methods: preferring shorter lines, matches closer to the start or end of the line, or preserving the original input order. Use this to control the ranking of matched lines when building interactive terminal UIs with fzf.",

It supports selecting from lists, maps, and command outputs, with features like custom tiebreaking, key event handling, and dynamic input updates. Concrete use cases include building CLI tools for file selection, configuration entry picking, and real-time filtering of log streams.",
