It works with a monadic type that wraps values and a queue-like structure for processing elements. Used to handle asynchronous tasks in a strict execution order, such as processing a stream of events with side effects.",

It supports binding operations to process elements sequentially, maintaining context between steps. Functions include adding elements to the queue, applying transformations, and executing side effects in order. This allows for structured handling of event streams or task pipelines where order and context are critical.",
