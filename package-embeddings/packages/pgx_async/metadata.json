It works with low-level data types like bytes and file descriptors, along with connection state tracking structures. Concrete use cases include sending SQL queries over the wire, receiving result packets, and handling SSL-wrapped communication channels.",

      "description": "This library enables asynchronous PostgreSQL interactions including connection handling, transaction management with isolation levels, and execution of parameterized or prepared queries. It operates on connections represented by `Pgx_async.t`, supports SSL and Unix domain sockets, and streams large result sets incrementally via `execute_pipe` for row-by-row processing. This design suits scenarios requiring real-time data access, such as processing extensive query results without waiting for full dataset retrieval.",
