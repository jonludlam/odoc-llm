It works with low-level data types like bytes and file descriptors, along with higher-level constructs such as SSL configurations and custom result types. Concrete use cases include sending queries over a network connection, receiving query results in chunks, and managing secure communication using TLS.",

      "description": "This module provides an asynchronous PostgreSQL client built on the Pgx library, enabling connection management, transaction control, and query execution with support for parameterized queries and streaming result sets. It offers core data types like connection handles and result streams, allowing operations such as executing SQL statements, handling large result sets row-by-row using asynchronous pipes, and managing secure connections via SSL. The child module for network I/O handles low-level communication, including reading and writing over sockets and TLS-secured streams, while the prepared statement module enables efficient execution of parameterized queries with functions like `execute_fold` and `execute_map`. Together, they support use cases such as bulk data insertion, transactional database operations, and real-time processing of query results in asynchronous applications.",

It is used for testing database interactions in isolation, such as verifying schema migrations or query correctness without affecting production data.",
