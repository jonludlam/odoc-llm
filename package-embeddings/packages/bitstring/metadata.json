It supports operations like `add_bit`, `add_byte`, and `add_bits` to construct a buffer that can be finalized into a `Bitstring.bitstring`. Concrete use cases include assembling binary data structures such as network packets or file formats with bit-level precision.",

      "description": "This module enables bit-level data manipulation through inspection, modification, and concatenation of bit sequences, represented as byte arrays with offset and length metadata, allowing precise control over endianness and bit patterns. It supports conversions to and from external representations like files, channels, and byte strings, making it suitable for parsing binary formats, implementing network protocols, and performing low-level compression. The child module facilitates incremental construction of bitstrings using operations such as `add_bit`, `add_byte`, and `add_bits`, which are useful for assembling binary structures like network packets with bit-level precision. Together, they provide a comprehensive interface for both building and analyzing bit-oriented data.",
