It supports standard hash table operations like insertion, lookup, and iteration, with the key feature that bindings are automatically removed when keys are no longer referenced elsewhere. Useful for memoization and caching where key identity matters and resource cleanup is needed.",

      "description": "This module implements core operations for constructing and manipulating Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) through stateful, low-level primitives. It provides functions for logical operations (negation, conjunction, disjunction, implication), structural transformations (permutation, folding), quantification, and inspection (equality checks, prime implicant extraction) over BDDs represented as `t` values, with variables tracked via `var` identifiers and managed by an implicit `man` context. These capabilities enable logic synthesis, formal verification, and combinatorial analysis tasks requiring efficient Boolean function manipulation.",
