Works with file descriptors, file paths, and directory entries, adhering to the Mirage_fs and Mirage_fs_lwt interfaces. Used to integrate Unix directories into MirageOS applications, enabling secure, isolated access to host filesystems.",

Works with strings, Cstruct.t lists, and custom error types for file system and write operations. Used to safely wrap exceptions and translate Unix errors into structured error results during file access.",

Operates on keys of type Mirage_kv.Key.t and returns results with specific error handling. Used to manage and query a persistent key-value store with support for dictionaries and versioning.",

Works with string-based paths, byte sequences represented as Cstruct.t, and custom error types for handling file system and write errors. Used to simulate file system interactions in testing or isolated environments where actual disk access is not required.",
