      "description": "This module implements filesystem operations for handling files in a MirageOS environment, including reading, writing, checking existence, and resolving filenames. It works with error types that combine Unix errors and custom filesystem exceptions, along with Lwt promises for asynchronous I/O. Concrete use cases include implementing virtual filesystem backends, handling file access errors in unikernels, and managing asynchronous file reads and writes with proper error mapping.",

      "description": "This module implements read-only key-value store operations backed by a filesystem, supporting lookups, existence checks, directory listings, and metadata queries like last modification time and value digests. It works with keys represented as hierarchical paths and values as strings, organizing data in a tree-like structure with dictionaries and values. Use it to serve static content from a filesystem-based store, such as hosting read-only datasets or versioned configuration files with fine-grained access and metadata tracking.",
