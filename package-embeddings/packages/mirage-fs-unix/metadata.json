Works with paths as strings, Cstruct.t buffers for data, and standard Unix file system structures. Useful for applications needing direct file access, such as log management, file synchronization, or local storage abstraction.",

It works with keys represented as hierarchical paths and values stored as strings, providing precise access to stored data and directory structures. Concrete use cases include serving static assets from a precomputed filesystem image or accessing versioned configuration data with digest verification.",

It includes pretty-printing utilities for errors and mechanisms to convert exceptions into typed error results. Concrete use cases include implementing file system interactions in MirageOS applications with precise error handling for operations like file reads, writes, and existence checks.",
