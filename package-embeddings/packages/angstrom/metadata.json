      "description": "This module enables the use of `let%bind`, `let%map`, and related syntax extensions for writing concise parser expressions using Angstrom's monadic and applicative combinators. It provides syntactic support for sequencing parsers, transforming results, and combining multiple parser outputs using functions like `bind`, `map`, `both`, and `map2` through the ppx_let pre-processor. Concrete use cases include parsing structured binary or text formats where readability and compositionality of parser steps are critical, such as protocol implementations or file format parsers.",

It operates on binary input streams, consuming bytes to decode values like 16/32/64-bit signed and unsigned integers, floats, and doubles. Use it to parse binary protocols or file formats that require strict big-endian decoding, such as network packets or structured binary logs.",

It includes functions like `take`, `take_while`, and `peek` that allow precise control over input consumption and inspection, returning slices of the internal buffer to avoid allocations. These operations are ideal for writing highly optimized parsers where direct buffer access is necessary and safety can be guaranteed by the caller, such as parsing binary formats or high-throughput network protocols.",

It works directly with user-managed input buffers and parser states, exposing control over input consumption and continuation via `partial.committed` and `partial.continue`. Concrete use cases include high-performance network protocol parsers where precise memory control is critical, such as parsing HTTP or binary protocols in event-driven servers.",

It provides direct access to operations like `bind`, `map`, `both`, and `map2`, allowing parsers to be written in a natural, imperative style while maintaining functional purity. Submodules extend this functionality to handle complex parsing tasks such as structured data extraction, binary protocol decoding, and custom format parsing with clear, composable syntax. Example uses include building JSON parsers, deserializing binary messages, or constructing configuration file readers.",

It works with parsers defined in the Angstrom module, handling input as either bigstrings or strings, and returns results in a state type that tracks progress, success, or failure. Concrete use cases include parsing network streams or file contents in chunks, where input arrives asynchronously or exceeds the initial buffer size.",

It supports fixed-size integer comparisons, arbitrary integer reads (signed and unsigned), and floating-point value parsing (float and double). These operations are useful for decoding binary protocols or file formats that require strict little-endian byte ordering, such as network packets or certain disk formats.",

It works with the `t` variant type, which represents consumption modes, and integrates with parser combinators to influence parsing behavior. Concrete use cases include selectively consuming input when parsing structured formats like binary protocols or custom text encodings where partial consumption is required.",

It provides core operations like `take`, `skip`, `choice`, and `repeat`, with direct buffer access and zero-copy IO through modules like `Buffer` and `Unbuffered`, allowing precise control over input consumption and error handling. Child modules add binary parsing capabilities for big-endian and little-endian data, integration with ppx_let for imperative-style parser composition, and utilities for partial input consumption and structured streaming. Examples include parsing HTTP headers with zero-copy semantics, decoding binary logs with fixed-endianness, or building custom deserializers with monadic sequencing and applicative composition.",
