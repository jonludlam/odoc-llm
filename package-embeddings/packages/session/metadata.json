Concrete use cases include handling user session storage in web applications where sessions must expire after a time or be explicitly cleared.",

It works directly with the `S.Now` and `S.Future` types, allowing synchronous values to be lifted into a future context. Concrete use cases include stubbing out blocking operations during testing or gradually integrating non-blocking code with existing synchronous logic.",
