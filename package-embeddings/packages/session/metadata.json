It defines a type 'a t for encapsulating computations, with operations like binding, lifting, and sequencing to manage control flow. Synchronous tasks can be executed directly, while asynchronous ones handle I/O and concurrency via deferred execution and thread isolation. Examples include performing file I/O in sequence, executing network calls without blocking, and running multiple tasks in parallel within a single thread.",
