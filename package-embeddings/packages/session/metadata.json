It works with session data types including keys, values, and time-based expiration periods, handling interactions with the underlying backend through IO operations. Concrete use cases include managing user sessions in a web application where sessions must expire after a defined period and support asynchronous access patterns.",

It works directly with the `S.Now.t` type, allowing synchronous computations to be lifted into a monadic structure for compatibility with lifting mechanisms. Concrete use cases include stubbing out blocking operations during testing or bridging between synchronous and lifted code without introducing concurrency.",
