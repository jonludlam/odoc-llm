It includes error variants for decoding failures such as invalid integers, overflows, and length limits, along with detailed error reporting for variants, sums, and polymorphic records. Operations allow efficient serialization and deserialization of binary data, with utilities to validate input and produce human-readable error messages during decoding. Example uses include converting between binary representations and OCaml values, enforcing protocol constraints, and debugging decoding issues in high-performance network or storage systems.",
