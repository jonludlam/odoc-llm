It supports data structures such as `StringMap.t` (representing string-to-'a mappings) and sequences of key-value pairs, enabling efficient bidirectional conversions (`to_seq`, `of_seq`) and reverse iteration (`to_rev_seq`). Typical use cases include aggregating values into lists under string keys, combining maps with custom merge logic, and processing key-value data from sequences.",
