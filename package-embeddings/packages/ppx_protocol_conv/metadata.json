It supports complex types including variants, records, and tuples, with dedicated `to_unit` and `of_unit` functions for handling `unit` values, ensuring error propagation via `Protocol_error` during failed deserialization. Use cases include protocol data encoding/decoding, data persistence, and inter-process communication where type-safe conversions are critical.",
