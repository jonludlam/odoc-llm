      "description": "This module offers key-value operations including partial reads, batched writes, and metadata management (e.g., modification times, digests) for string-valued entries. It interacts with sector-organized storage (`Sectors.t`) to handle direct disk-level data representation and supports hierarchical key namespaces (`Mirage_kv.Key.t`) for structured access. Its partial read capability enables efficient retrieval of specific byte ranges from stored values, useful for large data objects, while batched writes ensure durability through atomic updates.",

It provides direct access to predefined tag values used for struct direction, tail handling, and error states. These tags are used in low-level data structure manipulation and validation, particularly when working with tagged memory representations or serialization formats.",

      "description": "This library component offers an immutable integer set data structure with efficient operations such as insertion, deletion, membership testing, and set algebra (union, intersection, difference), maintaining elements in a strictly ordered format using a comparator. It supports ordered traversal, filtering, mapping, and partitioning, along with bidirectional conversion to integer sequences and lists, enabling use cases like deterministic ordered element processing and integration with sequential data pipelines. The design emphasizes performance-critical scenarios where set-semantic integrity and ordered data manipulation are paramount.",

It operates on `Cstruct.t` buffers to handle structured data with predefined constants for size constraints, supporting tasks like filesystem initialization and binary format parsing. Key applications include disk image processing and protocol implementations requiring strict adherence to binary metadata specifications.",
