It maintains revision counts and inter-block links while leveraging an ordered integer set submodule for managing immutable identifier collections. You can split oversized blocks, merge revisions, or serialize blocks for storage while using ordered sets to track and manipulate unique identifiers efficiently. The combination supports structured versioned data workflows with precise control over both block layout and set-based queries.",
