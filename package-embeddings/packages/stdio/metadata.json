It operates on input channels (`In_channel.t`) connected to sources like files and sockets, supporting use cases such as efficient file parsing, cross-platform text processing, and managing channel lifetimes to mitigate garbage collection overhead from frequent allocations.",

It includes utilities for channel lifecycle management (close, flush), formatted printing, and direct output to standard streams, suitable for applications requiring precise I/O control, though creating many channels may affect garbage collection due to finalizer overhead.",
