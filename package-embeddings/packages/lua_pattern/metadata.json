It supports finding the first match, matching from a specific position, and replacing matches using either a static string or a function that processes captures. The `Capture` submodule gives access to matched ranges and their corresponding substrings, while the `Match` submodule provides detailed information about each match, including its position, matched substring, and associated captures. Use this module to parse structured text, extract fields from formatted input, or perform complex string transformations based on pattern matches.",
