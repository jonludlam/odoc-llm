      "description": "The module handles configuring feature types (continuous or discrete), setting value bounds, and constructing decision trees, while managing training data and classifications. It operates on training sets, data vectors, and decision trees, enabling tasks like feature value association, range validation, and tree-based classification. Use cases include preparing structured data for machine learning models and ensuring discrete features adhere to specified integer ranges during tree generation.",
