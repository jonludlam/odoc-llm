It provides functions to propagate trace context through headers, extract and set tracing scopes, and manage spans with customizable attributes and kinds. Concrete use cases include instrumenting server endpoints for distributed tracing, correlating internal operations with incoming requests, and exporting telemetry data to observability backends.",

It works with Cohttp Lwt's client and server interfaces, allowing customization of span attributes and kinds during HTTP transactions. Use it to trace outgoing HTTP requests, correlate client-side operations with server-side traces, and capture detailed telemetry in distributed systems.",
