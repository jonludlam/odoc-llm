Operates with custom error types, a device handle type `t`, and `Cstruct.t` lists for data transfer. Used to manage I/O operations in a non-blocking manner, handle device-specific errors, and ensure proper buffer alignment for storage interactions.",

Operates on block devices and manages data as byte sequences within named files. Used to implement memory swapping in MirageOS by explicitly moving data between memory and persistent storage.",

Operates on custom types `t`, `handle`, and `error` to represent file states and errors.
