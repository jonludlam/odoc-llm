It supports storing metadata such as unique identifiers, source locations, and test specifications, which include either regular or parameterized benchmark functions.

It provides `set` to specify the library name and `unset` to remove it, controlling whether benchmarks are collected based on command-line arguments. These operations directly influence which benchmarks are retained for analysis by Core_bench during execution of inline benchmark runners.",

      "description": "This module coordinates the registration and management of inline benchmarks using a global hashtable indexed by library name, inspecting command-line arguments to determine whether benchmarks should be collected. It provides functions to add benchmarks and modules with source location metadata, and to retrieve benchmarks by library, enabling analysis with Core_bench via macros like `BENCH` and `BENCH_MODULE`. The module works with child modules that define benchmark entry structures and manage the current library name, allowing fine-grained control over benchmark collection. For example, setting a library name with `set` ensures subsequent benchmarks are registered under that name, while command-line inspection skips registration when benchmark runners are not in use.",

This function is commonly used when writing performance tests where certain expressions must be evaluated but their results are irrelevant.",
