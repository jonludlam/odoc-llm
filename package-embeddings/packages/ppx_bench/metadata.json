It maintains a hashtable of benchmarks indexed by library name, enabling dynamic registration based on command-line arguments. Operations include setting and removing flags, modifying test entries, and extracting module metadata. This allows for conditional benchmark collection and structured test evaluation during execution.",

Supports operations like flag manipulation, test modification, and metadata extraction, with benchmarks stored in a library-name indexed hashtable. Includes a utility function to discard expression results, allowing clean handling of side effects in imperative code. This enables precise control over benchmarking workflows and efficient management of irrelevant computation outputs.",
