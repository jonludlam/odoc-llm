      "description": "The module offers operations for managing a key-value map with internal IDs as keys and arbitrary data as values, including insertion, removal, iteration, and query functions that support ordered processing and predicate-based retrieval. It enables efficient handling of ID-based associations, such as tracking waiter states or managing dynamic data structures requiring ordered traversal and transformation. Specific use cases include maintaining state for internal identifiers, dynamically updating mappings, and performing structured data manipulations like splitting or folding over ordered key ranges.",

Works with DNS resolution results, socket addresses, and connection states. Used to implement reliable network connections in environments where IPv4 and IPv6 support varies across hosts.",

It handles ordered traversal and transformation of data, enabling operations like state tracking, dynamic updates, and structured data manipulations. Users can split mappings by key ranges, fold over ordered elements, or query based on custom conditions.
