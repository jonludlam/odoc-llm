      "description": "This module implements an ordered map structure for managing waiter values indexed by unique identifiers, supporting efficient key-based operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup, along with ordered traversal, filtering, and transformation. It works with key-value pairs where keys follow a total ordering, enabling range queries, sequence-based iteration, and structural manipulation such as merging or splitting maps based on key ranges. It is particularly suited for scenarios requiring coordinated management of waiters with unique IDs, such as tracking asynchronous operations or event-driven tasks where ordered processing and efficient membership checks are critical.",

      "description": "This module orchestrates concurrent connection attempts across multiple network addresses using the Happy Eyeballs algorithm, integrating DNS resolution with parallel IPv4 and IPv6 connection management. It maintains internal state for ongoing connection tasks and schedules attempts with configurable delays and timeouts, enabling robust client connection strategies that handle fallback and retries. The integrated waiter map supports tracking and managing asynchronous connection operations by unique identifier, allowing efficient lookup, ordered traversal, and filtered processing of active connection attempts. For example, a client can initiate dual-stack connections, track their progress, cancel specific attempts, or process results in order of completion or priority.",
