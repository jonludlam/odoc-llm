      "description": "This module implements a thread-safe sequencer that ensures operations are executed in the order they are enqueued, maintaining state between invocations. It works with arbitrary state types `'a` and functions that produce monadic results within the `Pgx_unix.Simple_thread.Sequencer.monad`. Concrete use cases include coordinating asynchronous database operations or serializing access to shared resources in a concurrent environment.",

It supports operations to prepare, execute, and close statements, with functions for mapping, folding, and iterating over query results. Use cases include executing parameterized queries for data retrieval, batch operations, and managing database-side resources like portals.",

      "description": "This module provides asynchronous network communication, byte stream manipulation, and thread-aware concurrency control using a monadic model over sockets, buffered I/O channels, and database handles. Its sequencer enforces ordered execution of stateful operations, allowing safe, serialized access to shared resources like database connections in concurrent settings. You can use it to coordinate asynchronous database queries, process binary network data, or manage thread-safe state transitions. The sequencer supports arbitrary state types and composable, monadic operations, making it suitable for complex, coordinated I/O workflows.",

It works with custom monadic types representing I/O actions and exceptions, enabling precise control over connection lifecycles and error handling. Concrete use cases include establishing secure connections, managing transactional I/O with rollback guarantees, and handling network errors during database communication.",

It supports direct execution of parameterized queries with `execute`, bulk operations via `execute_many`, and safe transaction handling using `with_transaction`. Submodules enhance this functionality by enabling efficient prepared statement management, asynchronous network communication with thread-aware concurrency via a monadic sequencer, and low-level I/O control for secure connections and precise error handling. Examples include coordinating asynchronous queries, executing parameterized batches, and managing SSL-enabled connections with rollback support.",
