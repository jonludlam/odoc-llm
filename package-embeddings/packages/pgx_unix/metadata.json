      "description": "This module provides a sequencer that ensures operations on a shared state are executed in the order they are enqueued, using a monadic interface to chain state transformations. It works with a generic state type `'a` and a monad that represents asynchronous or effectful computations. Concrete use cases include managing access to a database connection pool or coordinating state updates in a concurrent network server.",

It operates on socket descriptors and stateful objects requiring serialized modifications, particularly benefiting scenarios like database connection pooling and network service orchestration where ordered execution of effectful operations is critical.",

It works with PostgreSQL connections and prepared statement objects, supporting operations like binding parameters, executing queries, and processing results through mapping, folding, or iteration. Concrete use cases include safely running dynamic SQL with typed parameters, batching multiple executions, and managing server-side portals for result streaming.",

It works directly with I/O monads, SSL configurations, and PostgreSQL connection primitives. Concrete use cases include implementing secure network clients, managing connection lifecycles, and handling asynchronous I/O errors in PostgreSQL drivers.",
