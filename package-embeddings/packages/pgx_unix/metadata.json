It introduces a generic 'a t type for I/O contexts, statement handles for SQL operations, and a task queue for sequential execution. Users can perform safe file reads with error recovery, execute parameterized SQL queries, and chain dependent operations like database lookups followed by data transformations. Examples include safely reading from a file, executing a query with bound parameters, and processing a stream of data through a series of dependent steps.",
