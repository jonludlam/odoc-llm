It works with IPv6 addresses (`Ipaddr.V6.t`), network buffers (`Cstruct.t`), and result types for error handling. Concrete use cases include processing incoming IPv6 packets, transmitting fragmented or unfragmented IPv6 datagrams, and determining source addresses and MTU for IPv6 destinations.",

It provides functions to create client connections, listen on ports, send and receive data with optional buffering controls, and manage connection lifecycle events. Concrete use cases include implementing network servers and clients that require reliable, stream-oriented communication over IPv4.",

It supports listening on specific ports to handle incoming packets, writing outgoing packets with configurable TTL, and disconnecting from the UDP layer. Use cases include implementing IPv6-based network services, handling multicast or unicast UDP traffic, and integrating with low-level networking stacks.",

It operates on IPv6 addresses and TCP flows, supporting operations like `read`, `write`, `writev`, and their `nodelay` variants, along with connection management via `create_connection`, `listen`, and `close`. Concrete use cases include building IPv6 network servers and clients that require reliable stream-based communication with control over buffering and connection lifecycle.",
