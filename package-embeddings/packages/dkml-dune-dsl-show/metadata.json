It manipulates Dune DSL representations, such as build targets, dependencies, actions, and virtual library relationships, to construct structured OCaml project configurations. Specific use cases include defining module ordering, preprocessing rules, compilation flags, and customizing file installations or virtual library implementations.",

It processes a JSON structure containing parameter sets used in Mustache templates, allowing for dynamic configuration generation. Operations include setting up build targets, managing module dependencies, and configuring installation rules. Examples include generating build files with custom flags, defining virtual libraries, and applying preprocessing steps based on parameterized inputs.",
