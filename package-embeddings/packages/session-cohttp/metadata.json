It handles session creation, retrieval, and expiration through functions like `generate`, `of_key`, and `clear`, and integrates with HTTP cookies via `of_header` and `to_cookie_hdrs`. It is used to manage user sessions in web applications, where sessions are stored in a backend and identified by keys in HTTP cookies.",

It supports operations to generate, retrieve, update, and clear session keys with explicit expiration control. The module works with string-based keys and values, along with 64-bit integer expiration periods, making it suitable for web applications requiring secure, time-limited session tracking.",

It supports in-memory and external backends, working with session identifiers, metadata, and time-limited storage to maintain state across requests. Operations include initializing sessions from headers, generating cookie headers, and clearing session data, with common use cases in user authentication and stateful web interactions. Submodules define backends, IO integration, and session lifecycle operations, providing a complete stack for managing sessions in Cohttp-based web applications.",
