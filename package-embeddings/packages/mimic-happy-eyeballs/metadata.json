It provides `resolve` to connect to a domain or IP address through DNS lookups and TCP connection attempts, and `connect` to produce a context for reuse across components. It operates on domain names, IP addresses, and TCP flows, targeting scenarios where clients need to establish connections to remote services with support for IPv4 and IPv6.",

      "description": "This module implements asynchronous connection establishment with fallback mechanisms, using a state machine to manage connection attempts. It works with socket addresses and handles, along with custom error types for connection failures. Concrete use cases include robust client connection logic in distributed systems where multiple endpoints are available.",
