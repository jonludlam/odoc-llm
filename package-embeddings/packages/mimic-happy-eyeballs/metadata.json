      "description": "This module offers low-level control over TCP connections, enabling operations like establishing links, transmitting data, managing shutdowns, and handling errors during network communication. It interacts with network flows, IP addresses, and custom error types to facilitate reliable data exchange. Use cases include implementing network servers, client protocols, or custom transport layers requiring precise flow management.",
