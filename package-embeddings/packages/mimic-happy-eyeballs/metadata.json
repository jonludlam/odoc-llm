      "description": "This module implements connection management for TCP/IP stacks using a pre-allocated happy eyeballs resource to establish connections to a destination regardless of the user-specified target. It provides functions to resolve domain names or IP addresses into IP:port pairs and initiate TCP flows, with configurable timeouts and retries for connection and DNS resolution. Concrete use cases include resilient client connection setup in MirageOS applications where fallback between IPv4 and IPv6 is required.",

      "description": "This module implements the Happy Eyeballs algorithm for connecting to a destination using a mix of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. It provides a `resolve` function that attempts to establish a connection to a given domain or IP address across multiple ports, handling DNS resolution, connection delays, and timeouts. Concrete use cases include improving connection reliability and performance in dual-stack network environments by racing connection attempts across different address families.",

      "description": "This module orchestrates asynchronous connection attempts across multiple network endpoints, using timers and Lwt to manage fallback and concurrency. It coordinates DNS resolution, socket connection attempts, and timeouts, with support for retry strategies and dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 racing through its submodules. The core module handles connection management state, while one submodule resolves domain names and initiates TCP flows with configurable retries, and another implements the Happy Eyeballs algorithm to race connections across address families. You can use it to build resilient network clients that automatically fall back between IP versions or retry failed connections in distributed systems.",
