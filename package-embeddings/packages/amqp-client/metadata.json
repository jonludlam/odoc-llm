Works with input and output streams to read or write structured data types like headers, body frames, and properties. Used for parsing incoming AMQP frames into typed values and encoding typed values into bytes for outbound frames.",

It operates on a custom `t` type that encapsulates a buffer, an offset, and a sizing flag, tracking position as data is written. Concrete use cases include constructing AMQP protocol frames by serializing field values into network byte order with precise size tracking.",
