      "description": "This module offers operations to decode JSON values into OCaml values using primitive decoders for basic types (e.g., integers, strings), collection types (arrays, dictionaries), and structured data like tuples and records, alongside error-handling combinators for optional fields or fallback values. It supports monadic composition through mapping, chaining, and alternative selection to construct robust decoders that handle nested data, validate formats, or recover from partial failures during JSON parsing. Common applications include transforming API responses into typed OCaml models and safely processing heterogeneous or incomplete JSON structures.",

      "description": "This module enables structured parsing of JSON data into typed OCaml values through two core approaches: primitive decoders for basic JSON elements (null, numbers, strings, collections) and combinator-driven strategies for composing complex transformations. It leverages a monadic interface with operations like `map`, `bind`, and `either` to sequence decoders and handle validation errors, working directly on JSON abstract syntax trees represented as `Jsonoo.t`. Typical applications include deserializing nested JSON payloads into algebraic data types, handling optional or polymorphic fields, and validating schema constraints during data ingestion.",

It uses a decoder type that enables error handling through combinators like `nullable`, `try_optional`, and `try_default`, while monadic operations (`map`, `bind`, `either`) allow composing decoders sequentially or conditionally. Typical use cases include parsing JSON APIs into typed OCaml structures, handling optional or nested data, and building robust decoding pipelines with fallbacks and transformations.",
