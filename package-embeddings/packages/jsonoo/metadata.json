      "description": "The module offers functions for decoding JSON data into OCaml types, supporting booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, lists, tuples, and dictionaries, while managing nulls, optional values, and error recovery. It utilizes a `'a decoder` type with combinators to sequence, map, and compose decoding operations, enabling flexible parsing of nested or structured data. Specific use cases include transforming API responses, validating configuration files, and handling irregular input formats with robust error handling.",

It employs a monadic approach to sequence decoders, supporting error handling and flexible parsing of complex, hierarchical data. Use cases include parsing API responses, configuration files, or serialized data with varying structure requirements.",
