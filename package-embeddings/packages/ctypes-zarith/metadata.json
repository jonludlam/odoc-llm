It supports operations like initialization, assignment, conversion to and from Zarith values, and memory management via finalization. Concrete use cases include interfacing with C libraries that require `mpz_t` values while leveraging OCaml's Zarith for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.",

It supports operations like setting values from `Q.t`, converting pointers to `Q.t`, and creating or finalizing `mpq_t` instances with automatic resource management. Concrete use cases include interfacing OCaml code with C libraries that require `mpq_t` arguments or returning rational numbers from C functions into OCaml.",

      "description": "This module integrates GMP's arbitrary-precision integers and rational numbers with OCaml's Ctypes and Zarith libraries, enabling seamless interaction between C functions and OCaml values. It defines low-level bindings for `mpz_t` and `mpq_t` types, supporting initialization, assignment, conversion to and from `Z.t` and `Q.t`, and automatic memory management. You can pass big integers and rationals between OCaml and C, call C functions expecting `mpz_t` or `mpq_t` arguments, and safely convert results back to Zarith types. Example uses include wrapping GMP-based C libraries and handling cryptographic or numerical computations requiring arbitrary precision.",
