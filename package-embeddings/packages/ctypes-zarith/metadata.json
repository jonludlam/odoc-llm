It directly handles `ptr` types representing GMP integer pointers and supports concrete use cases such as performing arbitrary-precision arithmetic in C-compatible contexts or interfacing with cryptographic libraries requiring `mpz_t` values. Functions like `of_z`, `to_z`, and `make` enable seamless integration of Zarith values with C-based GMP operations.",
