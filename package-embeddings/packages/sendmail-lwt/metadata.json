      "description": "This module implements email delivery using SMTP over Lwt, providing two core functions: one for direct email submission to a destination host or IP (port 25 by default) using optional STARTTLS, and another for authenticated submission to an email authority (typically port 465 or 587) requiring TLS or STARTTLS. It works with IP addresses and domain names as destinations, handles TLS configuration and X509 authentication, and supports SMTP authentication when required. It is used to programmatically send emails from OCaml applications, either directly to recipient domains or via SMTP servers that act as relays, including support for DKIM-signing services like Gmail's SMTP.",
