Used to run tests with specific CLI flags, configure test behavior via command-line terms, and manage test execution flow and output.",

Tests are defined as tuples with names, speed levels, and functions that take a context and return a deferred unit. It allows running tests with specific CLI flags, managing execution flow, and handling asynchronous exceptions. Examples include running tests with timeout settings, filtering by speed, and capturing output during execution.",
