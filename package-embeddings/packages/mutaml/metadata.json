It works with `Ppxlib.pattern` and `Ppxlib.case` types to determine properties such as whether a pattern matches all exceptions, binds free variables, or if a set of cases contains overlapping or catch-all patterns. Use this module to validate pattern exhaustiveness and uniqueness in custom ppx rewriters or linters.",

It works directly with AST nodes and mutation lists to support mutation testing workflows, such as producing `.muts` files and updating mutation logs during compilation. The pattern analysis submodule examines `Ppxlib.pattern` and `Ppxlib.case` values to check for exhaustiveness and overlap, enabling validation of pattern matching logic. A separate submodule controls transformation behavior through mutable settings like random seed, mutation rate, and GADT support, offering direct access to runtime configuration parameters.",

It includes validation and fallback logic for parameters like seed values, mutation rates, and GADT flags, ensuring correct configuration from external inputs. The environment submodule extracts and converts variables with default handling, while the command-line submodule defines and processes flags that directly influence runtime behavior.

It works with `position` records containing file name, line number, beginning of line, and character number, as well as the `location` type, which likely represents a source code span. Concrete use cases include serializing and deserializing source code positions and locations to and from JSON, particularly when interfacing with tools that consume or produce such data, like linters or compilers.",

The `Loc` submodule handles conversion between position and location types and their JSON representations, supporting precise source code tracking. Use cases include serializing mutant data for storage, reconstructing source positions from JSON, and integrating with analysis tools via standardized formats.",
