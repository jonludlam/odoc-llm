The key points to cover are the main operations, the data structures they work with, and specific use cases. First, I need to go through each of the 27 function/type summaries and identify common themes. Let me scan through them again. The first few chunks talk about array creation, manipulation, and access, including initializing with numbers, zeros, ones, sequential values, or random distributions. They mention multi-dimensional arrays, indices, slices, shapes. So operations like creation, initialization, indexing, slicing. Then there's a lot about array manipulation: copying, reshaping, flattening, reversing, tiling, repeating, concatenating, stacking, squeezing, expanding, splitting, padding, one-hot encoding, printing. So transformation and reshaping operations. Element-wise math operations: trigonometric, hyperbolic, log, exp, sqrt, reduction operations like min. Then arithmetic operations (add, sub, mul, div), power, reductions (sum, max, min). Also, element-wise and scalar comparisons, returning booleans.
