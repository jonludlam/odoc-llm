Key data types include records, lists, arrays, and iterators, with operations like field access, list transformation, and sequence traversal. Users can validate and manipulate domain models, process large datasets efficiently, and handle infinite or incremental data flows. Examples include updating a specific user attribute, filtering log entries by severity, and generating values on demand.",
