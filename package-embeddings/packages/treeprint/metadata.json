      "description": "This module provides functions for constructing OCaml expressions and types with proper formatting and automatic parentheses insertion. It works with `ppr` values to represent fragments of OCaml code, enabling the composition of complex expressions through combinators like `if_then_else`, `tuple`, and operator functions such as `+` and `^->`. Concrete use cases include generating well-formatted OCaml code from ASTs, pretty-printing expressions with correct precedence, and building type representations with nested structures.",

Includes `format`, `buffer`, `show`, and `dump` operations for rendering structured data with proper indentation and parentheses. Useful for generating readable output for ASTs, expressions, or nested data structures during debugging or code generation tasks.",

It operates on expression trees and OCaml syntax structures via `ppr` and `t` types, automating parentheses insertion and precedence resolution through combinators like `binop`, `prefix`, and `parens`. It is particularly suited for OCaml code generation pipelines and pretty-printing complex expressions with nested operator associativity.",
