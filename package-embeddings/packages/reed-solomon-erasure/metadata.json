      "description": "The module implements Reed-Solomon erasure coding for encoding data into parity shards, validating shard integrity, and rebuilding missing data segments from available shards. It supports byte arrays, strings, and bigstrings, enabling applications such as distributed storage systems or resilient data transmission where data loss can be recovered if redundancy is sufficient. Operations include error-aware verification and reconstruction methods that accommodate pre-allocated buffers or optional inputs, requiring external error detection (e",

      "description": "This module tracks incremental encoding of data shards using a Reed-Solomon erasure code, allowing step-by-step processing of data as it becomes available. It operates on arrays of bytes, strings, or bigstrings, maintaining internal state to ensure correct shard encoding order and readiness. It is particularly useful in streaming scenarios such as real-time packet encoding over a network, where data arrives sequentially and must be encoded on receipt rather than in bulk.",

It operates directly on arrays of these data types, handling memory initialization and transformation required during encoding and decoding. These operations are essential for preparing and managing shard data before and after erasure coding.",

It provides functions to convert these errors into exceptions and to unwrap result values by raising them on error. Use it to handle or propagate errors during shard reconstruction or validation in erasure-coded data systems. The only child module is a placeholder with no additional functionality.",

It operates on bigstrings and provides direct encoding and decoding through the `ReedSolomon` and `ShardByShard` modules, supporting configurations with specified data and parity shard counts. The `ShardArray` module converts between optional and non-optional shard arrays, while the `Error` and `Config_error` modules define and handle failures during encoding or decoding. Examples include rebuilding lost data in distributed storage or recovering transmitted packets in streaming protocols.",
