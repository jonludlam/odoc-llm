      "description": "This module provides functions to convert between arrays of optional and non-optional shards for bytes, strings, and bigstrings, along with utilities to create blank shards and copy existing ones. It supports data reconstruction workflows by handling the transformation and initialization of shard data structures used in erasure coding. Use cases include preparing shard arrays for encoding, converting received shards into the required format, and duplicating shard data for redundancy or processing.",

It works with result types and exceptions, enabling callers to convert error values into exceptions or extract values from successful results. Concrete use cases include handling decoding failures due to excessive missing data or leftover shards after reconstruction.",

It handles byte sequences, strings, and bigstrings, working with arrays that include optional values and presence flags, while offering error handling through both exceptions and result types.",

It operates on byte arrays, strings, and bigstrings, maintaining internal state to ensure correct shard encoding order and readiness. It is ideal for streaming applications like real-time packet encoding over a network, where data arrives sequentially and must be encoded on receipt.",

It operates on byte sequences, strings, and bigstrings, using arrays with optional values to represent available or missing shards. Concrete use cases include distributed storage systems, streaming data transmission, and fault-tolerant data replication where missing fragments must be regenerated from available ones.",
