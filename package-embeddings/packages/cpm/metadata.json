      "description": "This module defines a data type `t` representing labeled data points with an associated score. It provides accessors `get_score` and `get_label` to retrieve the numeric score and boolean label of a data point. This structure is useful in machine learning evaluation for tasks like calculating ROC curves or precision-recall metrics.",

It supports curve generation, area-under-curve calculations, and Platt scaling for calibrating raw scores into probabilities, with optimizations for both pre-sorted and unsorted input. These tools are critical for evaluating and refining binary classification models, particularly in applications requiring precise metric computation and probabilistic score calibration.",

It operates on lists and arrays of numerical scores paired with boolean labels, optimized for both pre-sorted and mutable data. These tools are particularly useful in machine learning evaluation, drug discovery, and scenarios requiring precise model calibration or analysis of early recognition performance.",

It supports adding elements with scores, retrieving the list of elements in descending score order, and querying the current and maximum size of the collection. Useful for tracking high scores in games, maintaining leaderboards, or selecting top results from a stream of data.",

      "description": "This module fits and evaluates binary classifiers using ROC curves, computing true positive and false positive rates across thresholds and selecting the optimal threshold for classification. It processes labeled data where each label is a boolean and each instance includes a score indicating predicted class membership. The core functionality works with score-label pairs, which are defined and manipulated using the child modules for ranking, sorting, and computing metrics such as AUC, PR curves, BEDROC, and Platt-scaled probabilities. These tools enable precise model evaluation and calibration in machine learning and drug discovery, handling both sorted and unsorted input efficiently.",

It also generates raw Regression Error Characteristic (REC) curves for visualizing model performance across error thresholds. These functions are used to assess and compare regression models in machine learning tasks.",

It provides functions to read from and write to files, execute shell commands and capture their output, split and shuffle lists for training/test sets, create cross-validation folds, and divide lists into parts. Concrete use cases include preprocessing data files, evaluating models with different train/test splits, and organizing data for k-fold cross-validation.",
