It computes metrics like ROC/PR curves, AUC values, BEDROC scores, enrichment factors, and calibration-adjusted probabilities via Platt scaling, handling both sorted and unsorted array/list inputs. These tools are specifically used for model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and probability calibration in machine learning workflows involving binary outcomes.",
