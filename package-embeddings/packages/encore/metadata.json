      "description": "Provides bijective mappings between types using forward and backward functions, enabling reversible transformations. Works with pairs, lists, options, and structured data types like tuples and records. Supports operations such as composing mappings, flipping direction, and creating specialized conversions like string to unit or list to list.",

      "description": "The module offers combinatory parsing and serialization capabilities, enabling operations like choice, sequencing, and validation through customizable character predicates, string length constraints, and failure handling. It manipulates strings, arbitrary values, and a generic type `'a t`, alongside a `partial` record for intermediate state management. This is particularly useful for constructing robust data parsers or validators in scenarios requiring fine-grained control over input processing.",

Works with the sum type ('a, 'b) t, where 'a represents the success case and 'b the error case. Used to manage API responses where some calls may return data and others may fail with specific error messages.",

      "description": "This module offers parsing and serialization combinators for managing input/output streams, characters, strings, and lists, enabling operations like character classification, sequence construction, and recursive pattern matching. It supports use cases such as validating alphanumeric formats, constructing nested data parsers, and processing structured text through customizable combinator chains. Key functionalities include transforming streams with predicate-based collection, handling fixed-length segments, and combining parsers for complex data extraction.",

It supports operations on pairs, lists, options, and structured types, with functions to compose, flip, and specialize conversions, and includes error handling through success/failure types. Parsers and encoders are constructed using combinators that manage streams, strings, and custom validation, enabling precise control over input and output. Examples include parsing Git objects with isomorphic transformations, validating alphanumeric data, and serializing complex nested structures with guaranteed consistency.",
