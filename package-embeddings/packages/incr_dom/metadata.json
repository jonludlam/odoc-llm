It works with model types representing application state, action types encoding user input, and view types for UI rendering. Concrete use cases include structuring interactive UIs where state updates trigger view re-rendering and handling user events in a type-safe manner.",

It works with incremental values (`Incr.t`), node states, and graph representations to support use cases such as reactive UI updates, state stabilization via memoization, and debugging complex dataflows. Utilities for serialization, graph visualization, and invariant checks further aid in developing and inspecting dynamic, stateful systems.",
