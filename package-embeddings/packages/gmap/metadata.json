It works directly with Gmap's GADT-based key types and Map-compatible ordered key structures. Concrete use cases include sorting Gmap entries by key, implementing key-based priority queues, and validating key sequence constraints in parsed binary protocol extensions like TLS or IP options.",

It works with GADT-based keys that encode value types and a Map-backed structure to ensure O(log n) access while preserving invariants required by binary protocol parsing tasks. It is particularly suited for handling extensible tag-length-value encodings in network protocols, such as TLS extensions or DNS records, where type-specific handling and efficient, ordered processing of unique keys are critical.",

It maintains uniqueness of keys through controlled modification functions like `add_unless_bound` and provides combinators for ordered traversal, filtering, and merging of key-value pairs. Particularly suited for parsing binary protocols with extensible tag-value encodings (e.g., TLS extensions or IP options), it ensures type-safe access to heterogeneous data while preserving performance-critical invariants.",

It provides logarithmic-time insertion, lookup, and iteration, enforcing key uniqueness during construction, and is ideal for parsing binary network protocols with extensible tag-length-value encodings like TLS extensions or IP options. The child modules define ordered key relations, support transformations and combinatorial operations, implement the GADT key type with comparison logic, and provide the underlying map structure with efficient ordered traversal and type-preserving merges. Together, they enable tasks such as validating key sequences, safely handling typed extensions, and maintaining performance-critical invariants during protocol parsing.",
