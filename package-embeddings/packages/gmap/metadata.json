Operates on OCaml's stdlib Map structure, eliminating the need for manual packing of heterogeneous values. Designed for protocol parsing scenarios where different tags correspond to distinct value structures, such as handling IP options or TLS extensions.",

It works with key-value pair structures and employs custom types to define specialized behaviors for union and merge operations. Use cases include efficiently managing ordered data, aggregating datasets with predicate-based criteria, and dynamically combining maps using user-defined rules.",
