It supports transformation through iteration, filtering, and conversion between maps and sequences, enabling efficient manipulation of ordered data. Specific use cases include maintaining sorted datasets, dynamic key-value updates, and integrating map operations with sequence-based workflows.",

It works with graphs of computations represented as nodes and edges, supporting lazy evaluation and change propagation. Used to build responsive systems where data updates trigger minimal recomputation, such as in real-time data pipelines or interactive applications.",
