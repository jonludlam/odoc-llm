      "description": "This module defines a parser extension for pattern matching in PPX rewriters. It provides a rule that matches a specific AST pattern and transforms it into an expression, supporting the implementation of custom parsing logic in OCaml syntax extensions. The extension is used to define context-free syntactic constructs that can be integrated into the OCaml compiler pipeline.",
