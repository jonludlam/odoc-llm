It supports use cases requiring precise updates to deeply nested fields or managing state transformations in a purely functional manner, using infix operators for concise get/set/modify actions and control structures like conditional updates. The design emphasizes composability and immutability, allowing imperative-style field manipulations on complex structures while preserving functional purity.",
