It processes type declarations to produce lens modules or prefix-based lens functions, supporting features like submodule nesting and field prefixing. Key operations include deriving lenses from AST structures and signatures, generating record update functions, and creating module declarations. For example, it can automatically generate a lens for a deeply nested field, allowing field access and updates through a fluent, composable interface.",

It supports stateful computations and type-safe transformations through isomorphism-preserving operations, allowing lenses to adapt between related data representations. Infix operators provide concise get, set, and modify operations for direct manipulation of nested fields, while a state monad interface enables imperative-style updates to composite structures through lenses. Examples include updating deeply nested record fields and synchronizing values across isomorphic data forms.",
