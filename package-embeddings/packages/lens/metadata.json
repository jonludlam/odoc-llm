Includes infix operators for state manipulation within monadic contexts, allowing direct modification of accumulator values through setting, incrementing, decrementing, or appending. These tools support immutable data updates by focusing on specific parts of a structure and applying changes in a functional way. For example, it can increment a counter in a nested record or append to a list within a stateful computation.",
