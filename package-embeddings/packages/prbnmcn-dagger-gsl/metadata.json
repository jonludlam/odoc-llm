It provides functions to initialize a generator of a given type, seed it with a value, and generate uniformly distributed integers within a specified range. Concrete use cases include simulations requiring controlled randomness, such as statistical sampling or stochastic modeling.",

      "description": "This module offers operations for generating random samples and evaluating probability densities across a wide range of statistical distributions, including continuous (normal, exponential, gamma) and discrete (binomial, Poisson) types. It works with floating-point parameters, integer counts, probability arrays, and random number generator states (`Rng.t`) to support tasks like Monte Carlo simulations, statistical modeling, and probabilistic algorithms requiring distribution-specific stochastic sampling or density calculations. Specific use cases include Bayesian inference with Dirichlet priors, reliability analysis using Weibull distributions, and signal processing with Gaussian noise models.",

It operates on numerical types (float, int), categorical data, and user-defined types via hashtbl, leveraging the GSL RNG for deterministic random variate generation. Designed for statistical modeling and Bayesian inference workflows, it integrates with Dagger's distribution framework to handle mixture models, hierarchical distributions, and simulation-based tasks.",
