Its types enable the construction and analysis of abstract syntax trees with precise location information, facilitating accurate error reporting and source mapping. The position submodule enhances this by providing structured representations of parsed values with associated locations, supporting complex expressions like conditionals, lists, and named sections. Together, they allow developers to parse, manipulate, and validate opam files with detailed tracking of syntax elements and their origins in the source.",
