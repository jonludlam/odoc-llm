      "description": "This module connects Sturgeon and Inuit, enabling UI interactions through buffers and cursors. It supports creating and managing UI elements like buffers, shells, and menus, and handles input/output operations such as displaying messages, reading file names, and splitting windows. Concrete use cases include opening interactive buffers in an Emacs instance, displaying popup menus, and managing cursor placement with specific flags.",

It provides functions for recursive traversal and modification of s-expressions, conversion between lists and s-exps, and checking membership in s-exps. It includes low-level and higher-level input/output operations for reading and writing s-expressions to strings, buffers, channels, and file descriptors.",

It supports operations to establish connections, send and receive values, cancel sessions, and track pending continuations. Concrete use cases include implementing distributed computations where functions can be invoked across endpoints and managing streaming data through multi-shot continuations.",

It works with low-level data representations such as strings, buffers, and file descriptors, and provides structured access to Emacs-specific data formats. Concrete use cases include building editor extensions, implementing language servers for Emacs, and embedding Emacs as a frontend for OCaml applications.",

It works with `server` values, session management via `Sturgeon.Session.t`, and shell interfaces. Concrete use cases include setting up interactive text servers that respond to client input or managing persistent sessions with start, accept, and stop lifecycle control.",

It works with `Sturgeon.Session.t` and `Sturgeon.Stui.shell` to handle interactive commands, such as greeting a user, processing input, and responding in a REPL-like environment. Concrete use cases include implementing custom shell commands that interact with a user session, like displaying prompts or executing session-aware operations.",
