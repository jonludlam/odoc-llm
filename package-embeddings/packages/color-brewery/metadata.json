It operates on predefined color palettes structured as sequential gradients (e.g., light-to-dark transitions), qualitative sets (e.g., categorical hues), and thematic variations such as pastel or paired schemes. These tools are optimized for data visualization, thematic styling, and accessibility-focused design workflows.",

      "description": "This module combines color conversion, gradient generation, and palette management into a unified toolkit for creating and manipulating colors in RGBA, CMYK, and scalar formats. It supports operations such as extracting grayscale values, generating hue-based color ranges, and mapping data to colors using gradients or predefined palettes. The core module handles basic color transformations, while submodules enable advanced gradient sampling and palette evaluation for accessibility and thematic styling. Example uses include generating smooth transitions between colors, converting color representations for rendering, and selecting colorblind-safe palettes for data visualizations.",
