      "description": "Constructs gradients between two RGBA colors and samples them at a given position to return either RGBA or CMYK values. Operates on RGBA and CMYK color structures and a gradient type representing a color transition. Used to generate intermediate colors for visual effects or color interpolation in graphics applications.",

      "description": "The module offers functions to analyze color data (RGB, CMYK), assess palette properties (e.g., colorblind safety, print compatibility), and generate perceptually uniform gradients for data visualization. It manipulates color palettes and gradient lists (t list), enabling transitions like light-to-dark sequences or predefined sets such as bold, pastel, or paired hues. These tools are tailored for applications requiring accessible, visually consistent color schemes in scientific or design contexts.",

It handles RGBA, CMYK, and gradient structures, enabling tasks like creating smooth transitions, assessing color accessibility, and generating perceptually uniform sequences. Functions include sampling gradients at specific points, evaluating palette compatibility, and producing color schemes for visualization. Examples include blending two colors for a fade effect, checking a palette for colorblind safety, or generating a light-to-dark gradient for a chart.",
