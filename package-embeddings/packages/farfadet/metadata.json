It operates on primitive data types like `char`, `string`, `Bytes.t`, and `Faraday.bigstring`, allowing precise control over data serialization. Use cases include constructing binary protocols, generating text output, and embedding raw data in a streaming fashion.",

This is useful for high-performance networking or file I/O where data must be written in chunks without unnecessary copying.",

      "description": "This module implements a writer monad for building sequential binary data with precise control over memory layout, combining direct serialization of primitive types and collections with subwriter management for nested structures. It supports atomic writes of integers, strings, and booleans with explicit endianness, and uses bigstrings and Faraday encoders for memory efficiency. The module enables zero-copy serialization pipelines and structured data marshaling, with child modules handling direct buffer writes and vectorized bigstring scheduling for high-performance I/O. Example uses include binary protocol encoding, streaming text generation, and chunked network data transmission.",
