Manages operations on bigstring values, ensuring ordered execution for vector-based data structures, particularly useful in network I/O pipelines. Supports buffer allocation and data streaming by enforcing consistent operation sequencing. For example, it can serialize structured data into a pre-allocated buffer or manage incoming byte streams with guaranteed processing order.",
