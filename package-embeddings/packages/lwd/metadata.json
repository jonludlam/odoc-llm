Works with functor and monad types, enabling sequential computation and function application. Enables chaining of transformations in a readable, composable manner, such as parsing nested data or handling asynchronous workflows.",

Works with a private sequence type that supports concatenation and viewing elements without exposing internal structure. Used to maintain performance in pipelines where frequent updates could otherwise cause linear recomputation.",

Operates on sequences of 'a values and accumulates 'b results, supporting updates, reductions, and tracking of dropped elements. Used to process streams of data, aggregate results incrementally, and handle partial computations with explicit control over dropped items.",

Works with monoids defined as a value and an associative binary operation, and handles lists, sequences, and Lwd-typed values. Used for UI-related computations such as combining state updates, clamping values, and managing list transformations within a lazy, reactive context.",

Allows chaining of transformations to parse nested data or manage asynchronous workflows with clear, composable syntax. Key operations include binding, mapping, and lifting, enabling seamless integration of side-effecting or context-dependent functions. Examples include parsing hierarchical data structures or orchestrating asynchronous tasks in a functional style.",

It handles sequences of values with operations like map, filter, and fold, while reusing unchanged elements during updates. Reducers allow incremental aggregation of results, tracking dropped elements and supporting partial computations. Examples include building efficient data pipelines and processing streaming data with controlled state management.",
