It supports operations like mapping a function over a value, flattening nested monadic structures, and applying a function within a context to a value in the same context. These functions are used to compose reactive or lazy computations in a concise, readable way.",

It maintains state across updates and supports efficient incremental computation of aggregated values. Use it to compute sums, products, or custom aggregations over dynamic sequences, with precise control over how elements are transformed and merged.",

It works with elements of any type `'a` and structures them in a binary tree-like hierarchy to optimize access and modification. Concrete use cases include building dynamic user interfaces or event streams where sequences undergo frequent modifications and need efficient recomputation.",

It supports operations to prepend, append, and insert rows relative to existing ones, as well as direct access to row values with setting and unsetting capabilities. It is suited for interactive applications requiring dynamic data sequences with efficient incremental updates, such as UI elements or event-driven data pipelines.",

It combines incremental computation through dependency tracking and invalidation with low-level control over computation lifecycles, including sampling, callbacks, and logging. Designed for scenarios like reactive user interfaces or dataflow programming, it optimizes for efficient recomputation of dependent values when inputs change.",
