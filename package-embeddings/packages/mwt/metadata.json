It supports creating pools with customizable initialization and cleanup, running functions within pool threads, and handling asynchronous Lwt interactions. Use cases include offloading CPU-intensive tasks to separate threads, managing thread-local resources like database connections, and synchronizing between Lwt and preemptive threads.",
