It works with thread pools carrying per-thread state and provides operations to run functions within those threads, close the pool synchronously or asynchronously, and call back into the Lwt main context from a thread. Concrete use cases include offloading blocking or CPU-intensive tasks to separate threads while coordinating with Lwt's event loop.",
