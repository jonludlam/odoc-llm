It handles types such as synchronization policies, file paths, and configuration states, enabling the creation of serialized settings. Operations include generating URL-like representations for storing or transmitting file access parameters. Examples include setting up a buffered read-only file with mandatory locking or exporting a configuration with custom sector size for network transfer.",
