It includes submodules for building log messages with custom fields like timestamp, process ID, and log level, as well as managing log clients that control output destinations and formatting. Use it to route application logs into Apple System Log with precise control over message structure and delivery. For example, construct a log entry with sender, facility, and message content, then configure a client to write it to a file descriptor in a custom format.",

It works with the `Asl.Client.t` type to establish a connection for logging and integrates directly with the `Logs` library's reporting interface. A concrete use case is capturing application logs and forwarding them to the system log daemon on macOS for centralized monitoring and debugging.",
