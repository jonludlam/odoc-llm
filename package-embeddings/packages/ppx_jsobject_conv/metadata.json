It provides derivers for type declarations and extensions, enabling serialization and deserialization of OCaml records and variants to and from JavaScript object representations. It is used when defining types that need to interoperate with JavaScript, such as in OCaml-JS projects where data must be passed between OCaml and JavaScript code.",

It includes functions to generate expressions from these representations and to unroll them into more complex expressions, typically used during code transformation. The module is useful for generating and manipulating lambda or match expressions in PPX rewriters, particularly when handling JavaScript object conversions.",

It operates on `Js_of_ocaml.Js.t` values, using `Result.t` to handle errors during extraction or construction of data. Typical use cases include safely decoding JavaScript data structures into OCaml types, building JavaScript objects from OCaml values, and managing dynamic property access with explicit error handling.",
