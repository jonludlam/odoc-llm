It processes network addresses and domain configurations, returning structured results like evaluation outcomes, failure reasons, and explanation texts to support email validation workflows. Additional utilities convert these structured results into human-readable strings for logging, debugging, or reporting SPF evaluation details in mail servers and security tools.",
