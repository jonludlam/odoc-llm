Supports operations on strings, character lists, and tokens, allowing for value extraction, token generation, and string reconstruction. Can transform token lists into structured values, convert characters to tokens, and serialize tokens back to strings. Enables tasks like parsing configuration data, analyzing input streams, and generating output from internal representations.",
