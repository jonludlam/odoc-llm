      "description": "This module provides HTTP/2 server and client implementations for handling multiplexed request/response streams, connection management, and asynchronous frame processing over MirageOS-compatible network stacks. It defines core types like streams, headers, and frames, with operations for initiating and managing HTTP/2 connections, sending and receiving data, and handling server pushes and ping frames. The client module enables concurrent request handling and push stream management, while the server module supports per-stream processing of headers and data frames on incoming connections. Example uses include building scalable HTTP/2 APIs, real-time communication systems, and high-performance servers that process streams and trailers directly.",
