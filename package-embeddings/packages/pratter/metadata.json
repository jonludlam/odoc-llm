Operates on strings and operator precedence/associativity configurations to build hierarchical representations. Useful for parsing complex term-based languages like arithmetic expressions or lambda calculus.",

Supports parsing expressions such as x = y, \u00ac x, and x ! by specifying how to handle operator behavior and token conversion. Provides a concatenation function to merge operator sets, enabling complex expression structures. Allows custom parsing rules for non-operator tokens and defines how to combine parsed results into binary trees.",
