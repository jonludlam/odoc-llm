It operates on the internal Ocamlbuild phase system, modifying rule sets before the build process starts.

It centers on installing custom linking and preprocessing behaviors via the `install` function and setting up BAP-specific options to enable core functionality. Developers can use it in a `myocamlbuild.ml` script to activate BAP's build extensions, such as custom rule sets or plugin-based compilation pipelines. Example usage includes calling `Plugin_options.set ()` and installing rules to enable BAP-aware builds without relying on the `bapbuild` utility.",

It provides functions like `install` to set up custom linking and preprocessing rules, along with BAP-specific options to activate core features such as plugin-based compilation pipelines.
