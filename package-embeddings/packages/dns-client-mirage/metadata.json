It manages connection state, sends and receives DNS queries over a network stack, and handles timeouts and nameserver configuration. Concrete use cases include initiating DNS lookups over TCP or UDP, establishing secure connections with TLS, and handling concurrent queries with proper resource cleanup.",

It provides functions to resolve domain names to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, retrieve raw DNS replies, and handle EDNS options, with configurable timeouts, caching, and nameservers. Concrete use cases include initiating DNS lookups in networked applications, handling DNSSEC validation, and integrating with MirageOS-based unikernels for secure name resolution.",

It handles timeouts, EDNS options, and nameserver configurations, working with domain names, IP addresses, and DNS resource records. The transport submodule enables sending and receiving DNS queries over plaintext or TLS connections using a MirageOS network stack, supporting IP-based communication with configurable port numbers and TLS parameters. Together, they allow asynchronous DNS resolution with customizable network transport and error handling.",

It supports core operations like resolving A and AAAA records, querying arbitrary DNS resource records, and handling DNSSEC validation, with features such as EDNS, timeouts, and caching. The transport submodule manages network communication, allowing queries to be sent over plaintext or encrypted connections with configurable nameservers, ports, and TLS settings. Use cases include secure hostname lookups in unikernels, DNS-based service discovery, and custom DNS resolution pipelines with asynchronous I/O and error resilience.",
