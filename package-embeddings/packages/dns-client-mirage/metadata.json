Operates on IP addresses, ports, and Cstruct buffers to route and process network data. Used to establish and terminate UDP communication, demultiplex incoming traffic, and send packets with controlled network parameters.",

It works with network flows, IP addresses, ports, and a type `t` for connection state, supporting buffered and nodelay write strategies. Use cases include building reliable networked applications, managing flow control, and handling error conditions during data transmission.",

Supports IP address manipulation, error reporting, and low-level network operations like checksum generation and flow management. Functions include sending datagrams with custom TTL, establishing reliable TCP connections, and pretty-printing network-related data. Examples include building custom network protocols, inspecting incoming traffic, and configuring IP layer parameters.",
