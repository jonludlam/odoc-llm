It works with IP addresses, DNS protocols, and MirageOS network stacks to enable DNS queries over configurable nameservers and transport settings. Concrete use cases include initiating DNS lookups, managing secure connections via TLS, and handling asynchronous I/O operations for networked DNS resolution.",

It handles domain name resolution, resource record retrieval, and EDNS configuration, working with IP addresses, DNS packets, and MirageOS network stacks. Concrete use cases include DNS lookups for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, secure DNS resolution over TLS, and custom DNS record queries with configurable timeouts and nameservers.",
