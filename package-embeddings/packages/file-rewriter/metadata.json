      "description": "This module manages text transformations on file contents using insertions, replacements, and deletions at specific offsets and ranges, enabling automated code refactoring and text patching without modifying disk files directly. It provides data types for representing changes as substitutions and operations to apply and validate these edits, ensuring they are non-overlapping and within bounds. The child module handles invalid rewrite operations by capturing conflicts and overlaps, converting them into structured S-expressions for detailed error reporting. Together, they allow building and debugging complex text modifications while maintaining integrity of the original and transformed content.",
