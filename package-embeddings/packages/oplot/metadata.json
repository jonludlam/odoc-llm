It provides basic operations such as point creation, coordinate access, and vector arithmetic (addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication). These operations support tasks like 3D plotting, geometric transformations, and OpenGL rendering within the plotting library.",

      "description": "This module implements low-level rendering and interaction logic for 2D/3D plots, handling OpenGL context setup, coordinate system transformations, and real-time input event processing (mouse/keyboard). It operates on internal representations of geometric primitives (`plot_object`, `gllist`), view state (`view`), and UI flags to enable dynamic plot manipulation, LaTeX-based text rendering, and cross-platform window management. Typical applications include interactive data visualization tools with custom controls, animated scientific simulations, and export pipelines for publication-quality vector graphics.",
