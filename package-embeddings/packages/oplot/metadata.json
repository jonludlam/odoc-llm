      "description": "This module provides low-level rendering control for OpenGL contexts, coordinate transformations, and animation timing alongside UI event handling for mouse interactions and window resizing. It operates on plot devices, UI events, and application state to enable interactive plotting with dynamic configuration of visual properties like line widths or LaTeX rendering. Key use cases include real-time plot manipulation, responsive GUI layout adjustments, and precise coordinate mapping between screen and plot spaces.",

It supports rendering to OpenGL windows, image buffers, and vector formats like PDF, with core data types including plot configurations, geometric primitives, and animation states. The module provides operations for defining visual elements, managing interactive controls, and exporting high-quality output, while its child module offers low-level access to OpenGL rendering, event handling, and coordinate transformations. Examples include real-time data visualization with dynamic resizing, interactive 3D plots with mouse control, and exporting publication-quality figures with precise layout settings.",

It includes submodules for 2D and 3D point operations: the 2D submodule provides coordinate transformations, distance calculations, and comparisons for precise graphical rendering, while the 3D submodule defines a point structure with `x`, `y`, and `z` coordinates and supports scaling, translation, and distance computation. Main data types are 2D and 3D points represented by float coordinates, with operations such as translation, scaling, and distance measurement. Examples include defining plot markers in 2D, tracking cursor positions, and representing spatial coordinates for 3D plots and OpenGL rendering.",
