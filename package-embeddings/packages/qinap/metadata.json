It operates directly on the `string` type. These functions are useful for iterative parsing tasks where strings represent input streams, such as token extraction or character-by-character analysis.",

It provides primitives for parsing characters, strings, and numbers, along with utilities for handling delimited lists, whitespace, and nested structures, enabling precise error handling and compositional flexibility in applications like arithmetic expression or configuration file parsing. The string module offers `hd` and `tl` for iterative character extraction, while the char_list module facilitates conversions between strings and character lists, enhancing low-level input processing during parsing tasks.",
