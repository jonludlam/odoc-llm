It operates on resource values of arbitrary type `'r` and encapsulates them in `instance` structures that track ownership and handle cleanup. Concrete use cases include writing robust network servers where client-handling fibers may be canceled, ensuring opened connections or files are reliably closed, and safely transferring resource ownership between fibers without leaks.",
