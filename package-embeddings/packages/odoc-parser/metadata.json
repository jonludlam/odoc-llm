      "description": "<think> Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a 2-3 sentence description of the module based on the given summaries. First, I need to identify the main operations. The module deals with abstract syntax trees for ocamldoc comments. The functions create structured representations with nested data types for tables, code blocks, inline elements, etc. So the main operations are building and manipulating these ASTs. Next, the data structures. The summaries mention cells, rows, grids, tagged elements, headings, block elements, inline elements. Also, location tracking and styling info. So the module works with these structured data types, probably using trees or similar structures. Use cases: The module is for parsing and representing documentation comments. So specific use cases would be processing ocamldoc comments, generating formatted documentation, handling complex layouts. Maybe also for tools that need to analyze or transform these comments. Avoid generic phrases. Don't mention the module name again. Need to make sure each sentence covers one of the required points. Let me check the example response. It mentions structured representation, data types like tables, code blocks, inline elements, and use cases like parsing and generating documentation. Also mentions location tracking and styling. So I need to structure the sentences to cover main operations, data structures, and use cases. Let me draft: The module provides operations for constructing and manipulating abstract syntax trees that represent ocamldoc comments, utilizing nested data types for elements like tables, code blocks, and inline content. It works with structured data including headings, block elements, and styled text, incorporating location tracking for precise comment analysis. These structures support use cases such as parsing documentation comments and generating formatted output with complex layouts. Wait, but the user said not to repeat the module name. The example response starts with \"The module provides...\" but the user says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So maybe avoid \"module\" as well? Wait, the instruction says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So the module name is \"Ast\", so don't repeat that. So maybe start with \"This module...\" but the user says not to repeat the module name. Wait, the original instruction says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So the module name is \"Ast\", so the description shouldn't mention \"Ast\" again. So the example response starts with \"The module provides...\" but maybe that's acceptable? Or maybe the user wants to avoid even \"module\" as a generic term. Hmm, the example response uses \"The module provides...\", but the user's instruction says not to repeat the module name. Maybe the user wants to avoid using the module name in the description. So perhaps rephrase to avoid that. So, rephrasing: \"Operations for constructing and manipulating abstract syntax trees representing ocamldoc comments, using nested data types for tables, code blocks, and inline elements. It works with structured data including headings, block elements, and styled text, incorporating location tracking for precise comment analysis. These structures support parsing documentation comments and generating formatted output with complex layouts.\" But that's three sentences. The user wants 2-3. Maybe combine the first two. Let me check the example again. The example given by the user (the one in the problem) has three sentences. So maybe that's acceptable. But the user's instruction says 2-3. So maybe three is okay. But need to make sure not to repeat the module name. So the first sentence starts with \"Operations...\" instead of \"The module provides...\". That way, the module name isn't repeated. So the final answer would be something like: Operations for constructing and manipulating abstract syntax trees that represent ocamldoc comments, utilizing nested data types for tables, code blocks, and inline elements. It works with structured data including headings, block elements, and styled text, incorporating location tracking for precise comment analysis. These structures support use cases such as parsing documentation comments and generating formatted output with complex layouts. Yes, that avoids the module name and covers the required points. Check if all the data structures are mentioned: cells, rows, grids, tagged elements, headings, block elements, inline elements. The example mentions \"tables, code blocks, inline elements\" and \"headings, block elements, styled text\". Maybe \"tagged elements\" is also important. But maybe the summary is concise enough. The user's example includes \"structured comment data, organizing inline elements and block-level content\". So perhaps the answer should include that. Maybe adjust to \"structured data including headings, block elements, inline elements, and styled text\". But the user's example uses \"headings, block elements, and styled text\". So maybe that's sufficient. Also, the use cases: parsing and generating formatted output. The original summaries mention \"parsing and representing documentation comments\" and \"complex formatting and layout specifications\". So the use cases could be parsing documentation comments and generating formatted output with complex layouts. I think that's covered. So the",
