      "description": "This module provides imperative operations for interacting with a Unix filesystem and process environment, including file existence checks, reading and writing files, directory manipulation, timestamp retrieval, and subprocess execution. It works with paths represented as `Yocaml.Path.t`, handles errors via a `runtime_error` type, and supports logging and time-related actions. Concrete use cases include building static sites by reading source files, generating output files, and invoking external tools like compilers or linters during a build process.",

      "description": "This module enables running YOCaml programs on Unix systems, offering `run` and `serve` functions for building and serving static content with support for custom error handling, logging, and integration with YOCaml's effect system and path types. Its core functionality includes executing YOCaml pipelines, watching for file changes, and serving content locally, while child modules provide low-level Unix operations like file manipulation, directory traversal, subprocess execution, and timestamp handling. You can use it to generate static websites by reading and processing source files, writing output, and invoking external tools like compilers or linters during the build. The combination of high-level execution and low-level system access makes it suitable for both simple site generation and complex, automated development workflows.",
