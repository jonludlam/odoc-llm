It exclusively operates on `float` values, offering precise control over rounding modes through dedicated submodules for downward, upward, and zero-directional rounding. Designed for domains requiring rigorous numerical correctness, such as financial modeling and scientific simulations, it ensures reliable results in edge-case scenarios near zero or when handling critical floating-point boundaries.",
