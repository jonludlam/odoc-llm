It provides a type `t` representing cURL errors, along with functions to create errors from cURL codes, retrieve error messages, and check if an error is due to a timeout. It is used internally to handle and classify cURL-specific failures during HTTP communication.",

It defines an abstract type `t` representing a source, along with an empty source and a function to construct a source from a string.

It works with the `Cohttp_curl.Private.Sink.t` type, which represents a consumer of HTTP body chunks. Use `string` when you need to capture the full response body as a string, and `discard` when the response body is irrelevant.",
