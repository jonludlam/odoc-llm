It includes types for positions, ranges, expressions, constants, operators, comprehensions, and statements, along with operations to build and manipulate these structures while preserving contextual information. For example, it allows creating expressions with specific evaluation contexts, modeling boolean operations with custom behaviors, and tracking source locations for error reporting or analysis.",
