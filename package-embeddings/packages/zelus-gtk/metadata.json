      "description": "Implements a discrete event simulation loop that advances time in fixed steps. Accepts a time step and a function representing the simulation logic, then repeatedly executes the logic at each time step. Useful for modeling systems that evolve in discrete intervals, such as digital circuits or turn-based simulations.",

It processes homogeneous simulations of unit and boolean types, advancing their state with `go` and verifying expected outcomes at specific steps using `check`. Concrete use cases include testing circuit behavior over time and validating signal propagation correctness in digital logic simulations.",

It supports extracting current values from these widgets and integrates with window management operations like dynamic resizing, value retrieval from windowed interfaces, and initializing windows with predefined input configurations. These capabilities are particularly useful for building responsive graphical interfaces where structured user input and adaptive UI composition are required.",
