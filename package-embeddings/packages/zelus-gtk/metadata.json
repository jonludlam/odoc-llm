It handles `nvec` vectors and float-based time intervals, supporting operations like setting solver parameters, querying solution states, and scheduling function calls. Users can adjust integration tolerances, interpolate solutions, and trigger actions at specific times. This enables precise control over dynamic systems and real-time event handling.",

It enables the creation of structured plot layouts through windowing operations and supports nested environment management in systems requiring contextual isolation. Use cases include data visualization pipelines and interactive interface design where hierarchical or modular scope arrangements are necessary.",
