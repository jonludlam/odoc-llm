Works with floating-point time values and callback functions representing events. Use to model systems with discrete state changes at specific time intervals, such as digital circuits or timed automata.",

Operates on `unit hs imu` and `bool hs imu` types, which represent simulation states. Useful for managing state transitions and assertions in hardware simulation workflows.",

It works with signals representing data points, piecewise or linearly interpolated curves, and scopes that define viewports for visualizing these signals. Concrete use cases include real-time plotting of numerical data streams, configuring graphical displays for signal visualization, and updating plots at fixed time intervals.",

It supports simulation of systems with timed state changes using floating-point time values and control flow operations like `go` to advance simulation steps and `check` to validate state conditions. The core data types `unit hs imu` and `bool hs imu` represent simulation states and assertions. Example use cases include modeling digital circuits and verifying timed automata behavior at specific simulation intervals.",

It operates on structured input descriptions and primitive types (booleans, integers, floats) alongside window objects, enabling dynamic value extraction and string conversion. Use cases include building configurable input panels with nested layouts, capturing user input in GUI applications, and managing window creation with adaptive sizing based on input configurations.",

It includes predefined signal types like `piecewise`, `square`, and `linear`, and supports creating scopes with one to five signals, each with a name, signal type, and amplitude. Functions like `window` and `scopen` configure and display plots with specified ranges and multiple scopes, enabling real-time signal visualization in applications.",
