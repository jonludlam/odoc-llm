It works with a string-keyed ordered map structure, offering traversal, comparison, and conversion to and from lazy sequences for efficient processing. These capabilities are particularly useful for handling HTTP multipart form data, where maintaining field order and processing multiple values (e.g., file uploads) are critical.",

It extracts parts with metadata like name, filename, and body streams, and supports handling both string fields and file uploads. Concrete use cases include parsing file uploads and form submissions in web servers, where maintaining field order and extracting structured data are essential.",
