It tracks state changes via a dedicated type, facilitating scenarios like persisting user preferences, managing session data, or monitoring URL-related storage modifications. The functionality includes observing key-value alterations and maintaining historical data for rollback or comparison purposes.",

It operates on string-based values, URLs, and OCaml hashtables to track session state changes dynamically. This is particularly useful for real-time data synchronization or maintaining user session contexts in web applications.",
