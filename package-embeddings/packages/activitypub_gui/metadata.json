It works with log sources, formatted messages, and result types, enabling structured logging and error handling. Concrete use cases include logging application activity, handling failed computations with contextual error messages, and formatting diagnostic output for debugging or auditing purposes.",

      "description": "The module implements social interaction workflows and UI rendering for ActivityPub entities, supporting operations like liking, announcing, and replying to content through asynchronous Lwt-based workflows. It operates on ActivityPub objects (`AP.Types.object_`), IRIs (`Iri.t`), and GUI widgets (`Stk.Widget.widget`), with a focus on dynamic UI composition using boxes, styled components, and polymorphic object rendering. This enables building interactive federated social interfaces where user actions trigger ActivityPub protocol operations while asynchronously updating visual representations of notes, images, and links via the Stk toolkit.",
