It provides operations to create and destroy client instances, and to send OSC packets to a specified socket address. The module works with OSC packet data structures and Unix socket addresses, enabling direct communication with UDP-based OSC servers.",

It includes data types for OSC packets and socket addresses, with functions to send packets to a target address or receive and process incoming packets. Users can create a client to transmit OSC data to a remote server or set up a server to listen for and decode OSC messages from various sources. Example usage includes sending sensor data over a network or building an OSC responder that reacts to incoming commands.",

It defines data types for OSC packets and socket addresses, with operations to send and receive encoded OSC data. Users can transmit sensor readings to a remote endpoint or implement a server that listens for and decodes incoming OSC commands. Example applications include networked music controllers and interactive installations responding to OSC messages.",
