It emphasizes ordered key management and efficient lookups, updates, and structural manipulations. Use cases include processing ordered event streams, maintaining insertion-order-sensitive configurations, and handling range-based queries or bulk data ingestion.",

It provides core operations for rendering diffs as strings, with support for custom formatting through functions like `pp`. The colorized submodule enhances these renderings by adding ANSI codes to display removed lines in red and added lines in green, ideal for terminal diff tools. Together, they enable detailed, customizable, and color-aware diff visualization for tracking and resolving text conflicts.",
