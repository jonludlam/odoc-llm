      "description": "This module enables managing concurrent network transfers through a multi-handle interface, supporting operations to orchestrate asynchronous HTTP requests, monitor socket activity, and enforce connection policies like pipelining limits. It works with `Curl.t` handles, multi-handle stacks (`mt`), and Unix file descriptors to coordinate non-blocking I/O, timeout control, and event-driven networking. Typical applications include high-performance clients requiring parallel request handling, custom event loop integrations, or fine-grained control over network resource allocation.",

      "description": "This module provides low-level network communication capabilities, centered around the `Curl.t` handle, enabling fine-grained control over HTTP, FTP, and SSH transfers with support for SSL/TLS, authentication methods, and connection policies. It allows tasks such as implementing secure API clients with OAuth2, handling resumable file uploads, and inspecting detailed transfer metrics like connection timing and SSL handshake data. The multi-handle interface extends this functionality to manage concurrent transfers, enabling asynchronous request orchestration, socket monitoring, and non-blocking I/O coordination with Unix file descriptors. Together, these components support both single and parallel network operations, from simple HTTP requests to complex, high-performance, event-driven networking applications.",
