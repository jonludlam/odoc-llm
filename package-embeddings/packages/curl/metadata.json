It works with multi-stack (`mt`) and transfer (`Curl.t`) data structures, offering configuration options for connection limits, pipelining, and multiplexing. Designed for integration with external event loops, it suits high-performance scenarios requiring asynchronous handling of numerous simultaneous transfers, such as web scrapers or HTTP servers.",

      "description": "This module provides operations for configuring network requests, managing data transfers, and handling security settings for protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SSH. It works with types such as CURL handles (`t`), protocol-specific enumerations (e.g., SSL versions, authentication methods), and configuration options (e.g., timeouts, proxies, callbacks) to enable tasks like secure file transfers, concurrent asynchronous requests, and fine-grained control over network behavior. Specific use cases include implementing HTTP clients with custom headers, resumable FTP uploads with TLS, and multiplexed transfers using the `Multi` submodule for parallel I/O operations.",
