      "description": "This module provides low-level system operations involving integer-based constants and flags for file I/O, network configuration, process control, and terminal settings, alongside architecture-specific values for x86_64 Linux environments. It works with data types like `int`, `clockid_t`, `tcflag_t`, and `speed_t` to manage system calls, socket options, memory mappings, and hardware register access. Use cases include configuring file permissions, handling network protocols, controlling process signals, and manipulating terminal I/O settings through bitwise operations and system call parameters.",

Works with C-compatible data types such as integers, pointers, and structs, as well as platform-specific representations. Used to call C functions directly from OCaml, enabling low-level system interactions on supported architectures.",
