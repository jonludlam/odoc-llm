      "description": "This module provides low-level system interface definitions for x86_64 Linux, encompassing constants and type aliases for system call parameters, file descriptors, memory management flags, network protocols, and signal handling. It operates on integer constants and C-compatible types (e.g., `sa_family_t`, `clockid_t`, `speed_t`) to configure kernel interfaces, manage hardware interactions, and control process/thread behavior. Specific use cases include socket programming with protocol families like IPv6, terminal configuration for serial communication, memory-mapped file operations, and fine-grained control over Linux-specific features such as epoll I/O multiplexing, quota management, and CPU register manipulation.",

      "description": "This module enables low-level system programming through direct interaction with POSIX/Linux kernel interfaces, offering operations for managing file descriptors, memory regions, network sockets, and process attributes. It defines key types like `sa_family_t`, `clockid_t`, and `speed_t` alongside system call constants to configure hardware, control I/O, and manipulate process behavior. With support for socket programming, memory mapping, terminal configuration, and Linux-specific features like epoll and disk quotas, it provides the primitives needed for system-level tooling and embedded applications. Submodules extend this functionality with architecture-specific definitions and operations tailored to x86_64 Linux environments.",
