It includes definitions for system call flags, signal handling, memory mapping options, socket configurations, terminal control parameters, and error codes, all represented as integer constants and C-compatible types. These are used in OCaml applications requiring precise control over process management, network communication, memory operations, and device I/O on 64-bit Linux systems.",

      "description": "This module exposes low-level constants and types for direct kernel interaction in x86_64 Linux environments, focusing on system programming tasks like file descriptor manipulation, memory mapping, socket configuration, and process control. It operates on data structures such as terminal attributes, clock IDs, protocol families, and CPU register offsets, enabling precise management of resources like network interfaces, memory regions, and signal handlers. Specific use cases include configuring socket options for IPv6 multicast, setting terminal I/O flags, managing epoll event monitoring, and handling low-level process tracing or memory protection flags.",
