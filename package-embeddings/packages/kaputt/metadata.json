Key data types include `t` for custom values, `g` for generators, maps and sets for ordered collections, integer-indexed state records, predicate functions, and test configurations. It enables tasks such as inspecting complex data structures, building infinite data streams, maintaining sorted user data, retrieving dynamic parameters, validating input conditions, automating file workflows, simulating external behavior, and running property-based tests.",
