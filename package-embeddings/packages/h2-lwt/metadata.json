It works with H2 request and response types, along with client-specific error handlers and body writers. Concrete use cases include implementing HTTP/2-based API clients, streaming data with server push, and managing persistent connections with custom runtime behavior.",

      "description": "This module provides HTTP/2 protocol support for Lwt-based applications, enabling both client and server implementations with asynchronous stream handling, header management, and frame processing. It centers around socket-based communication, using request and response types to manage bidirectional data exchange, with support for server push, custom error handling, and connection lifecycle operations. The client module facilitates API clients and streaming over HTTP/2, while the server module enables scalable, non-blocking web servers with customizable request processing. Example uses include high-performance microservice clients, persistent HTTP/2 connections with runtime control, and asynchronous web servers handling TLS and multiplexed streams.",
