Operates on `flow` objects and buffers represented as `Cstruct.t`, returning results with specific error types for failed operations. Used to manage data transmission in network protocols, ensuring proper error handling and resource cleanup.",

Operates on byte sequences and cryptographic parameters to produce session keys for bidirectional communication. Supports encryption modes such as GCM, CCM, and ChaCha20_Poly1305 for secure data exchange between parties.",

      "description": "This module provides cryptographic operations for password-authenticated key exchange using SPAKE2+EE, including generating secret/public values, computing shared keys, and validating handshake steps. It works with types like `secret`, `public`, `client`, `server`, and `shared_key`, facilitating structured exchanges between parties to establish a secure channel. Use cases include enabling encrypted communication via symmetric algorithms like GCM or ChaCha20 Poly1305 after deriving a strong shared key from a weak password.",

      "description": "provides functions to read from and write to network flows using `Cstruct.t` buffers, with error handling and connection management. It supports both client and server handshake implementations, producing a `t` that tracks read and write readiness. The module allows upgrading flows to secured communication via symmetric ciphers using a shared password. For example, a server can accept a connection, perform a handshake, and send a \"Hello World\" message over an encrypted channel.",
