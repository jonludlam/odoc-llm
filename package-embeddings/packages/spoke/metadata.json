It handles `Cstruct.t` buffers for data transmission, offers `read`, `write`, and `writev` operations with error handling, and provides `shutdown` and `close` for connection termination. It is used to implement client-server protocols requiring reliable stream-based I/O, such as TLS or custom network services.",
