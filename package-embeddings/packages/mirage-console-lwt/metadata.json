It supports reading and writing of Cstruct buffers, including vectorized writes, with explicit disconnect and close operations. Use cases include interacting with virtual consoles in MirageOS unikernels, logging output to serial devices, and managing byte streams over flow-based console connections.",

It provides operations for reading from and writing to a console, supporting vectorized writes and explicit connection management via disconnect and close. You can use it to handle virtual console input/output in MirageOS unikernels, log data to serial interfaces, or manage flow-controlled byte streams. Example tasks include capturing guest OS console output or relaying data between a network service and a serial console.",
