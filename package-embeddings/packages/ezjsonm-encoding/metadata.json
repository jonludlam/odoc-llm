Works with a custom type 'a t representing a decoder that processes input and produces a value of type 'a. Used to construct complex JSON parsing logic by chaining simple decoder transformations.",

It defines a type 'a t for decoders that process input and yield values, supporting operations like binding, mapping, and pairing to compose transformations. This allows developers to construct intricate parsing logic by linking simple decoders, such as extracting a field from a JSON object and converting it to a custom type. Examples include parsing a JSON array of strings or decoding a nested record with optional fields.",
