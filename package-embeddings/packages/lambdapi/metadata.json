They specified to identify main operations, data structures, and mention use cases without generic phrases or repeating the module name. First, I need to parse the function/type summaries. The first chunk talks about translating parser-level AST nodes into Dedukti, working with identifiers, terms, parameters, logical assertions. The functions take AST types and return processed versions. The second chunk mentions translating AST to Dedukti, operations like removing term wraps, parsing rules, extracting modifiers, constructing AC types. They operate on parser terms, rules, modifiers, AST structures, focusing on syntactic transformation and annotation extraction. So the main operations are translating AST nodes into Dedukti format, syntactic transformations, and annotation extraction. The data structures include AST nodes, parser terms, rules, modifiers, AC types. Use cases would be converting parser ASTs to Dedukti, handling term wraps, parsing rules, extracting modifiers for logical assertions. Need to avoid generic terms. Instead of \"translation\", maybe \"converting\" or \"transforming\". Mention specific operations like removing term wraps, parsing rules, extracting modifiers. Data structures: AST nodes, parser terms, rules, modifiers, AC types. Use cases: preparing ASTs for Dedukti, handling syntactic elements, extracting annotations for logical assertions. Now structure into 2-3 sentences. First sentence: main operations and data structures. Second: specific operations and use cases. Maybe combine if possible. Let me check the example response. It mentions translating AST nodes, handling syntactic transformations, and specific operations like removing term wraps. Data structures: AST nodes, parser terms, rules, modifiers, AC types. Use cases: converting parser ASTs, parsing rules, extracting modifiers for logical assertions. I need to make sure not to repeat the module name. Also, avoid phrases like \"module provides\" since the user said not to repeat the module name. So start with \"This module...\" but the user said not to use the module name. Wait, the instruction says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So the module name is \"Rawdk\", so I shouldn't mention it. So start with \"The module...\" but the user says not to repeat the module name. Wait, the user says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So the module name is \"Rawdk\", so I shouldn't use that. So the description should not mention \"Rawdk\" again. So the description should start with something like \"This module...\" but the user says not to repeat the module name. Wait, the original instruction says \"based on the chunk summaries below, write a 2-3 sentence description that: ... specifies what data structures... mentions specific use cases...\" So the user wants the description to not repeat the module name. So the module name is \"Rawdk\", but the description shouldn't mention it. So the description should start with \"The module...\" but the user says not to repeat the module name. Wait, maybe the user means not to repeat the module name in the description. So the description should not include \"Rawdk\" again. So the description should start with \"This module...\" but the user says not to repeat the module name. Wait, maybe the user means that the description shouldn't use the module name again. So the original module is called \"Rawdk\", but the description should not mention that name. So the description should start with \"The module...\" but the user says not to repeat the module name. Hmm, maybe the user wants the description to not include the module name. So the answer should not have \"Rawdk\" in it. So the first sentence would be something like \"The module translates parser-level AST nodes into Dedukti representations, handling identifiers, terms, parameters, and logical assertions through syntactic transformations and annotation extraction.\" Then mention data structures and use cases. Let me check the example response. The example starts with \"This module...\" but the user's instruction says not to repeat the module name. Wait, maybe the user's instruction is that the description should not use the module name. So the answer should not have \"Rawdk\" in it. So the example response given by the user (the one they provided) starts with \"This module...\" which is acceptable because the module name is not repeated. So the user's instruction is to not repeat the module name, so the answer should not include \"Rawdk\". So the answer should start with \"This module...\" or \"The module...\" but the user's instruction says not to repeat the module name. Wait, the user says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So the module name is \"Rawdk\", so the description should not include that name. So the answer should not mention \"Rawdk\" at all. So the first sentence should start with \"The module...\" but the user says not to repeat the module",
