      "description": "This module provides RFC3986-compliant handling of Uniform Resource Identifiers, enabling construction, parsing, and normalization of URIs through immutable transformations. It supports operations on URI structures (`t`) and string components, including percent-encoding, query parameter manipulation, and resolution of relative URIs, with utilities for formatting and component extraction. The included regular expressions module facilitates validation and parsing of specific URI elements such as IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, authorities, and references. Example tasks include building URIs from scheme, host, and path elements, extracting host information via regex patterns, and normalizing URI strings for consistent representation.",
