It supports direct control over iteration counts and key length, operating on strings for all inputs and outputs. The child modules provide concrete implementations based on RFC 2898, enabling secure derivation of encryption keys or authentication tokens. Example usage includes transforming a user password and salt into a fixed-length key for AES encryption or HMAC generation.",
