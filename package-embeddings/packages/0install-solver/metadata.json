      "description": "This module implements an ordered map structure for managing key-value associations with `Role.t` keys, optimized for functional updates and ordered traversal. It provides operations like merging, filtering, and sequence-based construction/deconstruction, enabling efficient manipulation of solver output data while preserving key ordering. The structure is particularly useful for tracking component selections in a solver context, supporting ordered diagnostics and GUI representations through its ordered traversal and transformation capabilities.",

It works with types like `Result.Input.impl`, `Result.Input.rejection`, and `Result.Role.t` to describe why a component could not be satisfied or conflicted with others. Concrete use cases include explaining missing dependencies, version mismatches, command absences, and conflicts due to incompatible implementations or roles.",

It manipulates literals (`lit`) and variable states (`var_value`), organizing constraints into a structured problem space while allowing user-defined data integration via the `User` module.
