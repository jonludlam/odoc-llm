It supports efficient `push` and `pop` operations at one end for the owner domain, and `steal` or `steal_opt` operations at the other end for non-owner domains. It is ideal for task scheduling in multicore environments where throughput and data locality are prioritized over fairness.",

Works with arbitrary OCaml values and provides fixed-capacity ring buffers via `push_exn`, `try_push`, and corresponding `pop`/`peek` operations.

It works with a custom `t` type for the counter, `once` for tracking single-use updates, and `update` for specifying increment or decrement actions. It is suitable for tracking the size of concurrent collections like linked lists where threads must update the size without locks, ensuring correctness even under high contention and counter overflow.",
