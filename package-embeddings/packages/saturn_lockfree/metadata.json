It supports creation of size counters, atomic updates limited to a single application per counter, and safe retrieval of the current value, even in the presence of concurrent modifications. It is suitable for tracking the size of concurrent collections such as lock-free stacks or queues, where accurate and efficient size tracking is required across multiple threads.",

It supports FIFO operations including push, pop (with both `exn` and `opt` variants), and peek (also with `exn` and `opt`), making it suitable for concurrent task scheduling and shared work queues in multicore environments. The queue is ideal for high-concurrency scenarios where mutual exclusion would be too costly.",

      "description": "This module provides a lock-free work-stealing deque designed for single-producer, multi-consumer use cases, where the owner performs push and pop operations at the front and other threads steal from the back. It enables efficient, low-contention task scheduling in multicore systems by leveraging local LIFO execution for data locality and high throughput. The main operations include push, pop, and steal, with the former two used by the owner and the latter by remote threads. Submodules refine this behavior with variations that maintain these core principles while optimizing for specific runtime conditions and domain interactions.",
