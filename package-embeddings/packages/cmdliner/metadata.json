      "description": "This module provides applicative-style operators for combining and transforming command line terms. It supports operations like mapping a function over a term and combining multiple terms into tuples. These operators work with values of type `'a Cmdliner.Term.t`, representing command line arguments and their evaluations. Use cases include composing complex command line interfaces from simpler terms, such as validating input or combining multiple options into a single result.",

It provides constants for common exit statuses like success, CLI errors, and internal errors, along with functions to create and query exit code ranges and documentation. These features support consistent error reporting and man page generation for command line tools.",

It supports creating executable commands with custom parsing logic, handling errors during evaluation, and mapping results to standardized exit codes. Subcommands can be nested to model tools like `git` where each command has distinct options and behaviors.

It handles positional parameters, optional flags, and repeated arguments with customizable error messages, supporting use cases like parsing configuration options, user-provided data files, or multi-value parameters with constraints such as minimum/maximum values or allowed string patterns. Key operations include splitting and converting argument strings, enforcing required values, and documenting argument alternatives through combinators and quoting utilities.",

It provides core operations to compose terms using applicative-style combinators, allowing functions to be mapped over terms and multiple terms to be combined into structured results. Main data types include `'a Term.t` for representing command-line values and functions to convert evaluations into exit statuses. Examples include parsing optional arguments with default values, defining subcommands with distinct behaviors, and validating input through composed term transformations.",
