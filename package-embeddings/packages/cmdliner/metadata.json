It provides predefined constants for common exit statuses like success, CLI errors, and internal errors, along with functions to document and describe these codes. Use it to specify and document exit statuses in a structured way, particularly when generating man pages or handling error reporting in command line tools.",

These operators enable building complex command line interfaces by combining individual terms representing command line arguments. Use `let+` to apply a function to a term's result, and `and+` to pair values from two terms, directly defining the structure of expected command line inputs.",

      "description": "This module defines how environment variables are described and linked to command line interface elements. It provides the `info` function to create structured metadata for environment variables, specifying their documentation, deprecation status, and associated documentation sections. It works directly with environment variable names (`var`, as strings) and constructs `info` values that integrate with command definitions to govern how environment variables influence command behavior. Concrete use cases include documenting required environment variables for command execution and marking obsolete variables as deprecated in generated help output.",

It works with terms representing CLI parameters and commands, alongside metadata structures for documentation, environment variables, and exit conditions. Specific use cases include declarative CLI construction with support for optional arguments, validation, man page generation, and structured error handling during program execution.",

It handles basic types (integers, strings), structured values (lists, tuples, pairs), and constraints like required/repeated arguments, while supporting environment variable integration and path validation. Typical use cases include building robust CLI tools with validated inputs, enforcing argument structure through custom separators, and generating documented alternatives for user guidance.",

It works with `Term.t` values and `info` metadata to specify command-line syntax, environment variables, exit codes, and help text. Concrete use cases include building multi-command tools like `git` or `docker`, where each command has its own set of options, arguments, and documentation, and where structured error handling and help generation are required.",

It operates on types such as `block` for content organization and `format` for specifying output styles (e.g., Groff), enabling use cases like generating terminal-friendly help output or escaped markup for command-line interfaces. Utilities include conditional content exclusion, variable substitution, and rendering to formatters for seamless integration with CLI tools.",
