It directly works with the `bytes` type, enabling efficient handling of binary data and string-like sequences. Concrete use cases include parsing network protocols, constructing binary file formats, and optimizing memory-intensive string operations.",

It supports parsing and validation tasks such as extracting binary-encoded integers, verifying byte patterns, and decoding strings in-place. Concrete use cases include binary protocol parsing, file format decoding, and network packet inspection.",
