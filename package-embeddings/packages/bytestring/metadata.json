Works with a custom `t` type representing a binary input buffer, and `bytestring` as an alias for the same type. Used for parsing binary protocols, decoding serialized data, and validating expected byte patterns.",

Works with bytestring type, allowing precise control over data encoding. Used to build binary data structures incrementally, such as network packets or serialized formats.",

Operates with process identifiers, message queues, and asynchronous channels to coordinate behavior across multiple cores. Used to build fault-tolerant systems such as distributed servers and real-time data processors.",

It supports extracting and reading data from a binary stream, as well as appending strings, integers, and bit patterns to build structured binary outputs. Operations include parsing protocol fields, validating byte patterns, and generating network packets or serialized formats. Examples include decoding a binary message header or constructing a custom data frame with specific bit-length fields.",
