      "description": "This module provides functions to iterate over and consume binary data from a bytestring, including reading individual bits, bytes, UTF-8 sequences, and fixed-size values. It supports parsing and validation tasks such as extracting binary-encoded integers, checking for expected byte patterns, and consuming data incrementally. Concrete use cases include decoding binary file formats, network protocols, and structured binary data with strict layouts.",

      "description": "This module efficiently builds byte strings by appending strings, bits, integers, or UTF-8 encoded data to a transient buffer. It supports incremental construction of binary data structures such as network packets, binary file formats, or compact serialized representations. Operations include adding raw strings, bitfields, integers, and UTF-8 content with optional size constraints, ending with a commit to finalize the result.",

      "description": "This module offers an efficient, immutable byte string abstraction with optimized operations for slicing, concatenation, and conversion to and from standard strings and Iovec structures. It supports low-level manipulation and inspection of binary data, including direct access to length and memory layout, making it suitable for network protocols, file parsing, and buffer management. The first child module enables structured consumption of byte strings, providing primitives to read bits, bytes, integers, and UTF-8 sequences, ideal for parsing binary formats and validating data layouts. The second child module facilitates incremental construction of byte strings, allowing efficient appending of integers, bitfields, and UTF-8 data before finalizing into an immutable byte string, useful for building network packets and binary encodings.",
