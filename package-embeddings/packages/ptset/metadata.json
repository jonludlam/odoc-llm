The Patricia tree structure ensures unique representation, enabling efficient structural comparison and canonical forms for equality checks. It is particularly suited for efficiently handling large sets of positive integers where fast merges, ordered value partitioning, and canonical representations for equality validation are required.",

Its unique representation ensures structural equality, enabling direct use of OCaml's comparison and hash-consing optimizations. It is particularly suited for applications requiring persistent, high-performance set manipulations with ordered integer elements, such as symbolic computation or mergeable state management in functional algorithms.",

It supports standard operations like membership testing, insertion, deletion, and set algebra, along with advanced features such as element selection, mapping, and partitioning. The child modules extend this functionality with optimized handling of non-negative integers, ordered value partitioning, and efficient merge operations. Examples include managing sparse integer ranges, symbolic computation state, and persistent set manipulations where canonical forms and fast merges are critical.",
