It provides a function to create a client instance with an API key and constructs request URLs based on a given endpoint. The client works with string-based API keys and uses a Curl handle for making network requests. A typical use case involves initializing the client with an API key and using it to send completion or embedding requests to OpenAI's API endpoints.",
