It manages key-value associations where keys represent XML elements or attributes, maintaining their natural ordering for deterministic processing. Such mappings are useful for tracking hierarchical relationships in XML data, such as aligning nodes during tree differencing or aggregating attribute changes across document versions.",

It operates on XML trees represented by the `xmltree` type, with support for navigating and modifying elements through precise path specifications and attribute mappings managed via the `Nmap` module. Concrete use cases include synchronizing XML document versions, generating human-readable change logs, and applying incremental updates to XML-based configurations or documents.",
