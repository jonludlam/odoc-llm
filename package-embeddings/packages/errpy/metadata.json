It serializes structured elements such as numeric literals, function arguments, and pattern-matching components into human-readable formats, aiding in debugging and error reporting. These utilities are particularly useful during AST manipulation or analysis, where inspecting node structures is critical for tasks like code transformation or static analysis.",
