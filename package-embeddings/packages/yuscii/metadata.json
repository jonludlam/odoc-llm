It supports incremental UTF-8 processing, allowing retrieval of decoded characters or malformed sequences as they occur. A child module provides position-aware string folding, enabling transformations that combine character data with their byte offsets, ideal for lexers or text processors. Together, they facilitate low-level byte-to-character decoding and high-level, position-sensitive string analysis.",
