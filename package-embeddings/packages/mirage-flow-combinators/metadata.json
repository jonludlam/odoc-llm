      "description": "Implements efficient data transfer between two flow endpoints, handling errors from both source and destination. Works with `A.flow` and `B.flow` types, combining their error variants into a unified result type. Useful for streaming data between network connections, files, or devices while tracking transfer statistics.",

      "description": "This module implements bidirectional data proxying between two flow interfaces, transferring data until both ends close. It tracks I/O statistics during the proxy operation and returns them on success, or propagates errors encountered in either direction. The proxy function connects two flow endpoints, making it suitable for scenarios like network tunneling or stream bridging where transparent data forwarding is required.",

      "description": "This module enables in-memory I/O operations using function-based flows that manipulate buffers such as `string`, `bytes`, and `Cstruct.t`. It supports reading, writing, and lifecycle control (shutdown, close) with customizable buffer refill strategies for both single-buffer and collection-based data handling. The combinators are particularly useful for testing network protocols, simulating device interactions, or implementing memory-backed I/O pipelines without relying on external hardware or system calls.",

It provides functions for reading from and writing to a flow, handling shutdown and close operations, and includes typed errors for failed writes. Concrete use cases include implementing network protocols where precise error handling and flow control are required, such as TCP-based communication layers.",

It works with `Cstruct.t` buffers and provides typed errors for failed I/O operations, supporting in-memory testing and simulation of network protocols. Concrete use cases include building and testing TCP-based services, implementing protocol proxies, and simulating device I/O without hardware dependencies.",
