Reads block until data is available, returning a buffer with at least one byte, while writes accept a buffer or list of buffers and ensure they are fully transmitted. Offers shutdown and close methods to terminate flow interactions, with distinct behaviors for read, write, and combined modes.",

It works with `Cstruct.t` buffers, integers, and specialized handlers for strings, bytes, and custom error types. Use cases include network-like communication, buffer management, and robust write operations with detailed error tracking.",
