It is used to set up a node that operates independently without inter-node communication capabilities. Concrete use cases include configuring isolated test environments or single-node deployments where messaging between nodes is not required.",

It provides functions to create and manage node configurations, specifying remote nodes as triplets of IP, port, and name, along with local binding and connection settings. Use this module to set up a node that communicates with peers over TCP, such as in a cluster of microservices or a distributed computation network.",

It works with message types, process identifiers, and node configurations, supporting use cases such as fault-tolerant distributed systems, dynamic node discovery, and asynchronous inter-process communication with Lwt-based workflows. Key patterns include broadcast messaging, lifecycle monitoring, and integration with IO operations for networked applications.",

It works with log sources, levels, and reporters to enable remote logging in distributed systems. Concrete use cases include coordinating log output in multi-node applications and aggregating logs from different services over a network.",
