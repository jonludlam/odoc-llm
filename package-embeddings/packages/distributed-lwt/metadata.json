It includes operations to specify remote nodes (as IP/port/name triplets), set the local port, connection backlog, node name, and IP address. Concrete use cases include setting up a node's network parameters for peer-to-peer communication in a distributed system.",

It works with string-typed node names and is used to set up nodes that do not communicate with others. Concrete use cases include configuring standalone test nodes or local services that operate independently within a larger distributed architecture.",

      "description": "This module combines distributed process management with customizable messaging and logging to enable resilient, concurrent applications across networked nodes. It provides process spawning, message passing, monitoring, and dynamic node configuration, operating on types like process IDs, node addresses, and message payloads. Use it to build fault-tolerant microservices that adapt to node failures or manage distributed state through reliable inter-process communication. Submodules handle both networked node setup with IP and port configuration, and lightweight local node identity management for standalone services.",

It works with `Logs.level` and leverages `Logs_lwt` for asynchronous logging. A concrete use case is logging customer-related events in a distributed system where asynchronous logging is required without blocking the main execution flow.",

It enables non-blocking log operations via promises, allowing applications to log events such as customer actions or system state changes across networked nodes. Combined with its submodules, it supports both distributed process management and fine-grained logging control, handling tasks like node configuration, message passing, and local or networked logging setup. Use it to build resilient, concurrent services that require asynchronous logging and dynamic node management.",
