      "description": "This module offers low-level decoding primitives for converting `Js.Json.t` values into OCaml types, including primitives like strings and integers, as well as composite structures such as arrays, lists, and options. It enables building complex decoders through combinatorial composition, supporting field access and error handling for robust JSON parsing. Use cases include transforming nested JSON data into structured OCaml values and managing decoding failures with detailed error messages.",

It includes targeted handlers for homogeneous arrays (e.g., float, int, bool) and ensures seamless integration with JS runtimes by leveraging their JSON serialization conventions. Use cases include serializing OCaml data structures for client-side JavaScript execution or API interactions.",

It processes JSON values and `'a of_json` structures, enabling structured data parsing and validation. Use cases include converting JSON inputs into typed OCaml values and managing parsing errors gracefully during data serialization workflows.",
