Direct API functions `to_yojson` and `of_yojson` handle serialization and deserialization, while submodules provide specific conversion functions between JSON and message types, including error handling for robust parsing. Examples include serializing server responses with `SAdd_file` or deserializing client `Rename` commands from JSON into typed values for processing.",
