      "description": "Combines type and syntax construction with stateful transformations, enabling the creation and modification of OCaml AST nodes, types, and module structures while tracking location and managing state. It handles operations on expressions, patterns, classes, and modules, supporting function arrows, constructor types, and annotated tokens with stateful updates. Users can generate structured code, apply transformations, and manage inheritance and type constraints through stateful mappings. It allows for the creation of transformation functions that modify environment and type representations, such as converting types with stateful context.",

Main data types include polymorphic types and location-aware structures like `Ppxlib.expression`, `Pat.t`, and `Typ.t`, with operations for generating and manipulating code constructs. It enables tasks such as creating polymorphic function types, generating class method definitions, and assembling module structures with equality constraints. Examples include testing equality of nested data structures and generating type-safe comparisons during code transformation.",
