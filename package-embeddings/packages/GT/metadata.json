It centers around plugins as core data types, with operations for registering, executing, and customizing transformation logic, alongside AST nodes, type declarations, and naming constructs for precise code generation. You can implement custom PPX rewriters that derive data type instances, generate string representations for types, or transform recursive structures using plugin-defined rules, all while maintaining source location fidelity and type consistency. Key workflows include extending OCaml's syntax through AST rewriters, automating boilerplate generation for algebraic types, and embedding domain-specific transformations into the compilation pipeline.",
