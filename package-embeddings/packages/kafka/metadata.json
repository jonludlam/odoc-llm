It works with Kafka producers, sinks, and partitions, allowing precise control over message delivery to specific topics and partitions. Concrete use cases include sending log events to a Kafka cluster, ensuring reliable message delivery with custom error handling, and distributing data across partitions based on keys.",

It supports configurable consumer and topic properties, timeouts, and end-of-stream behavior, working directly with Kafka partitions, topics, and message queues. Concrete use cases include consuming messages from specific partitions, replaying topics from given offsets, and processing queued messages across multiple topics and partitions.",

It supports sending messages to specific topics and partitions with customizable error handling, as well as consuming and folding over message streams from defined offsets. Key data types include producers, consumers, partitions, and message queues, with operations for sending, receiving, and transforming data. Examples include reliably publishing log events, replaying topic partitions from specific points, and aggregating messages across multiple topics.",

It handles core Kafka primitives like topics, partitions, offsets, and messages, while integrating metadata operations to inspect topic configurations and partition lists. You can configure producers and consumers, track offsets for fault-tolerant processing, and query cluster metadata to dynamically adapt to topic structures. Specific use cases include real-time analytics pipelines, event-driven architectures, and scalable log processing systems.",
