Operates on a record type containing these fields, each corresponding to a specific AWS Lambda runtime attribute. Used to instrument logging, tracing, and context-aware error handling within serverless functions.",

It supports generic value types and provides utilities for converting between maps and sequences or JSON representations, enabling tasks such as data serialization and configuration management. Specific use cases include processing structured data, integrating with external systems via JSON, and performing efficient key-based data transformations.",
