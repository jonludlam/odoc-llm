Specific examples include serializing policy attributes into JSON for API requests, parsing XML listener configurations into structured data, and generating query parameters for tag management.",

Handles operations such as applying security groups, configuring health checks, managing policies, and modifying load balancer attributes, using specific input and output records and error representations. Examples include serializing policy configurations into JSON, parsing XML listener settings, and generating query parameters for tag management. Works with AWS service identifiers, request signing, and XML/JSON decoding to support a wide range of load balancer management tasks.",
