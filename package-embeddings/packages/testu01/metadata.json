      "description": "The module provides statistical testing operations for evaluating randomness in random number generators (RNGs) and binary bitstreams, employing specialized batteries like SmallCrush, Rabbit, and Alphabit to analyze sequences of floating-point numbers or bit blocks. It processes data structures such as RNGs, binary files, and bitstreams, with tests tailored to detect correlations, distribution anomalies, and statistical dependencies through p-value analysis and block-based processing. Use cases include validating cryptographic RNGs via FIPS-140-2 compliance, assessing hardware generators with Alphabit, and diagnosing failures in pseudo-random sequences using iterative retesting of suspect tests.",
