      "description": "This module implements a deterministic, pure functional ChaCha PRNG that generates random values of multiple types (bool, float, integers) and supports splitting states into independent streams. It operates on state values initialized from seeds or derived through self-initialization, with each operation returning an updated state alongside the result. The ability to split states enables forkable random number generation, useful for reproducible simulations or branching probabilistic computations.",
