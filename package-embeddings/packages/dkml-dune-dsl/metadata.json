It works with structured representations of build metadata, internal types such as `[ `Dep ]` and `[ `Action ]`, and symbolic values to express complex logic. Use cases include defining executable targets, managing library dependencies, and specifying file installation paths.",

It processes structured data like names, paths, and build rules, enabling parameterization of string values through external JSON configurations. This allows reusable Dune logic for generating multiple similar build configurations without duplication.",
