It operates on byte buffers using `decoder` and `encoder` types, processing input/output through incremental steps like `Await`, `End`, or `Char`. Concrete use cases include parsing and generating email headers that contain non-ASCII text encoded with quoted-printable, such as subject lines or encoded sender names.",

      "description": "This library decodes and encodes quoted-printable streams used in email transmission, handling data incrementally through buffers, channels, or strings while tracking malformed sequences and buffer usage. It supports both stream processing per RFC2045 and inline encoding/decoding per RFC2047 for email headers, using types like `decoder` and `encoder` to manage state across steps such as `Await`, `End`, or `Char`. Main operations include converting quoted-printable encoded input to raw text and vice versa, handling non-ASCII data in headers like subject lines or sender names. Examples include parsing email content during message reception and generating encoded payloads or headers for transmission.",
