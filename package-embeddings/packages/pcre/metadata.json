It provides string transformation operations for substitution, splitting, and iterative matching, along with low-level control over match limits and optimization settings like JIT compilation. It operates on compiled regex patterns, character tables, and match result structures, facilitating tasks such as parsing structured text, extracting hierarchical data from logs, and implementing domain-specific language processors with customizable pattern behavior.",
