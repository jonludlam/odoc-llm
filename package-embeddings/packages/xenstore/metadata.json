It provides core data types such as `Store.Path.t` for hierarchical paths, `Transaction.t` for atomic updates, and `Perms.t` for permission enforcement, along with operations to create, read, write, list, and delete nodes under transactional and secured contexts. The system supports concurrent access through client session tracking, watch management, and asynchronous I/O via Lwt, enabling actions like setting a node value with access restrictions, listing child nodes under a transaction, or enforcing per-domain quotas. Additional components handle symbol mapping, trie-based data organization, debug heap interaction, and resource cleanup, allowing advanced use cases such as secure configuration namespaces, dynamic virtual machine introspection, and policy-driven access control.",
