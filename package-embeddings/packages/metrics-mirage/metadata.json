Handles demultiplexing incoming packets to TCP, UDP, or custom protocols, and constructs IP packets with options for fragmentation and TTL. Works with IPv4 addresses, interfaces, and callbacks for packet processing, supporting tasks like sending and receiving network traffic.",

It works with IP addresses, ports, Cstruct buffers, and flow handles, supporting operations like listening, sending, reading, writing, and error handling. Examples include processing incoming UDP packets, establishing TCP connections, and constructing IP packets with custom options. It facilitates low-level network interaction with fine-grained control over data flow and protocol handling.",
