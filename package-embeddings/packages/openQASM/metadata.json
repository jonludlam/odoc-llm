Enables parsing, analysis, and generation of intermediate representations by transforming and inspecting program structures. Operations include building expressions, annotating statements, and validating semantic constraints. Examples include converting arithmetic expressions into tree structures, extracting identifiers from code, and checking type consistency in declarations.",
