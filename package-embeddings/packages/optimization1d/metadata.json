It provides two algorithms: `brent` for general maximization on a closed interval and `golden_search` for cases where an intermediate point with a higher value is already known. These functions are used in optimization tasks where a single-variable function's maximum must be located efficiently within a bounded domain.",

Operates on real-valued functions with floating-point inputs and outputs, requiring interval bounds and optional tolerance parameters. Useful for numerical optimization tasks in scientific computing and engineering applications.",
