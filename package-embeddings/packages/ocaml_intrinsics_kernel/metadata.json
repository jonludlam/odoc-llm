      "description": "This module implements bit manipulation operations for a custom integer type provided by the parameter module `I`. It offers three core functions: `count_leading_zeros` to count leading zero bits, `count_set_bits` to count the number of 1 bits, and `count_trailing_zeros` to count trailing zero bits. These functions are useful for low-level numerical algorithms, compression, and bit-based data processing where precise control over binary representations is required.",
