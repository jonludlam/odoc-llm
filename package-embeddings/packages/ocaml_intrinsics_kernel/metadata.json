It offers three core functions: `count_leading_zeros` to count leading zero bits, `count_set_bits` to count the number of 1 bits, and `count_trailing_zeros` to count trailing zero bits. These functions are useful in low-level numerical algorithms, such as optimizing bitwise operations or implementing efficient arithmetic routines.",
