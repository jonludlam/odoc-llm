It directly offers basic map manipulations such as insertion, lookup, and iteration, centered around the `t` type representing the map itself. One submodule extends it with bulk operations like merging and filtering, while another adds serialization capabilities for converting maps to and from string representations. With this structure, users can efficiently manage key-value associations, transform collections of data, and integrate with external formats like JSON or environment variables.",

It supports operations like `union`, `inter`, `diff`, `filter`, and `map`, along with safe access via `find_opt`, working directly on `t` values or through sequence-based pipelines. Child modules extend functionality to ordered and hashed representations, enabling optimized set operations across different use cases. Examples include deduplicating string lists, computing set intersections for access control, or transforming identifier collections through mapping functions.",
