      "description": "This module provides associative map operations for string-keyed collections, supporting creation, modification, and querying of key-value pairs with both safe (option-returning) and unsafe access patterns. It works with immutable maps (`'a EzCompat.StringMap.M.t`) and sequences (`Stdlib.Seq.t`), enabling transformations like folding over bindings, filtering entries, or merging maps with custom strategies. Typical use cases include managing hierarchical configurations, processing string-indexed data with functional pipelines, and converting between map and sequence representations for interoperability with other modules.",
