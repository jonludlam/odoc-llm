      "description": "This module provides a comprehensive framework for constraint programming and combinatorial optimization, centered around finite domain variables and set domains. It supports precise domain manipulation through set operations, arithmetic expressions, and logical constraints, with data types like `Fd.t` for integer domains, `SetDomain.t` for sets of integers, and `Cstr.t` for constraints. Users can model complex problems involving scheduling, resource allocation, and permutation constraints using features like all-different constraints, sorting, extremum tracking, and logical reification. Specific capabilities include defining domain variables with interval bounds, enforcing constraints with priorities, optimizing goals with custom strategies, and debugging through logging and assertions.",
