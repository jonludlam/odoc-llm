Works with Bigstring.t and string types, enabling low-level buffer management. Enables high-performance data processing in network protocols and file I/O where speed and memory control are critical.",

It works with Bigarray-based bigstrings, enabling efficient memory-sharing via views and direct interaction with string-like types. Use cases include high-performance networking, binary file parsing, or systems where minimal overhead in data transformation is critical.",
