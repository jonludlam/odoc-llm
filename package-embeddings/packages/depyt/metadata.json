Works with OCaml's native types, including records, variants, and recursive structures, using GADTs for precise type handling. Used to implement serialization formats that dynamically inspect and traverse complex data structures without runtime type errors.",

It works with structured data types including records, variants, lists, arrays, and recursive definitions, using GADT-based abstractions for precise type handling. Specific use cases involve generic programming tasks such as dynamic value inspection, conversion between formats, and handling custom type hierarchies.",
