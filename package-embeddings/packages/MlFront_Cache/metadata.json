It operates on `file_entry` and `dir_entry` types, enabling concrete actions like updating metadata after file writes or validating directory structures during initialization. The child module extends this functionality by implementing cache updates and deletions based on category and key, allowing for conditional path updates and removal of outdated entries. Together, they support efficient cache management through direct metadata manipulation and categorized cache entry operations.",
