It provides functions to construct and manipulate labeled arguments with associated types and names, specifically handling OCaml's abstract syntax tree structures for generating JavaScript interoperability code. Key operations include creating single or multiple arguments, extracting type information, and converting argument lists into typed pairs for code generation.",

It supports use cases like dynamic data aggregation (via `cardinal`), key-based iteration (e.g., `find_first`), and bidirectional transformations between maps and sequences for processing or construction. The structure is ideal for scenarios requiring flexible key-value associations with efficient access and transformation capabilities.",
