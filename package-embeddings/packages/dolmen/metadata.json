      "description": "Provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing logical outcomes, identifiers, terms, and mappings, along with utilities for pretty printing, timing, and diagnostics. It includes data types such as `t` for identifiers, maps for key-value associations, and term structures for symbolic computation, with operations for hashing, comparison, substitution, and formatting. Users can construct logical assertions, track variable scopes, manage SMTLIB2 extensions, and generate diagnostic messages, enabling tasks like theorem proving, compiler development, and constraint solving. Examples include normalizing logical terms, handling overloaded functions, and tracking performance metrics.",
