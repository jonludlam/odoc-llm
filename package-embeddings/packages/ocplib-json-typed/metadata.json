It works directly with Yojson values and the `Json_repr.view` type to ensure compatibility with common JSON structures. Concrete use cases include parsing JSON data into Yojson for efficient processing and serializing processed data back to a standard JSON format.",

It operates on a custom `Repr.value` type, allowing manipulation of domain-specific JSON representations such as ASTs or encoded formats without intermediate conversions. You can extract fields from configuration files, update deeply nested values, or merge partial JSON payloads directly into existing structures.

It provides core operations for mapping OCaml data like options, lists, and associative structures to JSON through an intermediate representation, allowing schema-driven validation and precise error handling. The child module extends this by offering direct construction and deconstruction of JSON values over arbitrary OCaml types, using a custom representation for flexibility in encoding and decoding domain-specific structures. Together, they support tasks like API data interchange, configuration parsing, and persistent storage serialization with type-safe, composable tooling.",

Specific use cases include converting JSON data between libraries for processing, serializing structured data into readable or compact formats, and decoding or encoding JSON using intermediate representations that simplify manipulation.

The child module supports serialization and deserialization workflows, allowing schemas to be encoded to or decoded from external JSON formats using specific conversion functions. For example, users can programmatically build a schema, convert it to a JSON-like structure for storage, and later reconstruct the schema from that representation.",
