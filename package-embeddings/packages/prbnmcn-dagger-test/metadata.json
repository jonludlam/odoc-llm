      "description": "This module tests resampling algorithms used in sequential Monte Carlo methods, ensuring correctness and robustness across different distributions and resampling strategies. It works with particles represented as arrays of values with rational weights, supporting operations such as stratified and iterative resampling, mass normalization checks, and correctness testing on both crafted and randomized cases. The module leverages a QCheck-based measure generator to create and manipulate structured distributions for property-based testing, and uses a rational arithmetic module to ensure precise numerical computations during resampling. Together, these components enable rigorous validation of resampling strategies such as stratified and systematic resampling based on effective sample size thresholds.",

It provides core data types like arrays and map structures, along with identity and stateful monads for managing effects and incremental computation. Operations include `bind`, `map`, and `map2` for composing effectful and pure transformations, enabling pipelines that integrate logging, configuration access, and structured data manipulation. Example uses include validating and transforming hierarchical data while interleaving state updates or logging, and testing map-reduce workflows with controlled side effects.",
