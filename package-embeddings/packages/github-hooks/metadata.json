      "description": "This module supports set algebra (union, intersection, difference), element-wise queries (membership checks, min/max retrieval), and transformations (filtering, mapping) on ordered collections of repository values. It employs a set data structure that enforces uniqueness and sorted traversal via a comparator, with utilities to convert between sets, lists, and sequences while preserving order. Typical applications include managing repository groups with strict membership rules, enabling bulk updates through set operations, or processing repositories in a deterministic sequence for synchronization tasks.",

Concrete use cases include tracking repository membership in webhook events, applying bulk actions across sets of repositories, and ensuring consistent repository identity checks.",
