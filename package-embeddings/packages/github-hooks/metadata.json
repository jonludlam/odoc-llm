It supports transformations like mapping and filtering, ordered iteration with `fold` and `iter` functions, and conversions to and from lists and sequences. These capabilities are used for managing repository collections with efficient associative operations, ordered enumeration of elements, and bulk updates from sequence-based inputs.",
