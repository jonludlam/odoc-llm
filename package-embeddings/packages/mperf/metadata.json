It supports operations to create, read, reset, enable, and disable counters for specific performance metrics like CPU cycles or cache misses, using attributes and flags to control measurement scope and behavior. Concrete use cases include monitoring application performance during execution, analyzing resource usage in containers, and gathering low-level system metrics for profiling tools.",
