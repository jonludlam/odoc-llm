It provides functions for reading from and writing to input and output channels, including line-based reading, exact byte reading, and flushing writes. Concrete use cases include implementing network protocols, handling streaming data, and building asynchronous communication layers over Unix sockets or pipes.",

It supports creating server and client endpoints, reading and writing data with optional vectorized operations, and managing connection lifecycle through shutdown and close operations. Concrete use cases include building secure, bidirectional communication between virtual machines in a MirageOS unikernel or coordinating data transfer over shared memory channels in a domain-specific protocol.",

It supports reading lines or fixed amounts of data, writing strings, and flushing output, all in a non-blocking manner. Concrete use cases include network communication over Unix domain sockets or pipes, where data must be exchanged asynchronously between processes or threads.",

      "description": "This module enables asynchronous communication over Xen vchan connections using Lwt, allowing domains to exchange data through bidirectional channels identified by `domid` and `port`. It provides `open_client` and `open_server` to set up connections, returning Lwt I/O channels for reading, writing, and managing data flow with configurable buffering. Submodules extend this functionality with utilities for line-based I/O, vectorized reads and writes, and connection lifecycle management, supporting use cases like implementing network protocols or coordinating inter-VM communication. Together, they enable efficient, non-blocking data transfer over shared memory channels and Unix-based endpoints such as sockets and pipes.",
