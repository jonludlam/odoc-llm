It provides direct APIs for running commands like `hg status` and `hg log`, while its child modules enhance async workflows by lifting values into deferred contexts and supporting context-aware transformations with additional runtime parameters. The first child module simplifies composition of non-blocking operations through a monadic `return` function, and the second allows dynamic modification of values alongside command arguments, such as adding flags or changing directories. Together, they enable flexible, composable, and error-resilient asynchronous Mercurial interactions.",
