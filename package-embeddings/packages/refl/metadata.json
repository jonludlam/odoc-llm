Submodules support effectful traversals with `Applicative`, type structure manipulation via `Type`, and arity-preserving transformations through `Visitor` and `Visitors`. Example uses include generic serializers that validate data with `Result`, deep mappers that preserve type integrity across recursive structures, and type-aware pretty-printers built by composing visitors with applicative sequencing.",
