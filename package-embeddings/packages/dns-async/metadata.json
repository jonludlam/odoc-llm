It works with Unix-specific networking data types, including `Ipaddr.t` and `Async.Deferred.Or_error.t`. A concrete use case is performing non-blocking DNS lookups in networked applications such as web clients or servers.",

It supports query operations like `resolve` for general DNS record retrieval and `gethostbyname` for resolving hostnames to IP addresses. The module works directly with DNS packets, names, and IP addresses, enabling low-level network interactions such as implementing custom DNS clients or integrating DNS lookups into asynchronous network stacks.",
