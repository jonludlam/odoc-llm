It provides operations for merging, filtering, ordered traversal, and structural transformations, along with conversions to sequences and lists, which are critical for diagnostics, GUI representations, and combining selections while maintaining key order. The structure is particularly valuable for scenarios requiring structured analysis of solver results, such as dependency resolution or user-facing visualizations where role-based data relationships must be preserved.",
