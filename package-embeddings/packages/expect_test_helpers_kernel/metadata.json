      "description": "This module provides a function `require_allocation_does_not_exceed` that checks whether a given function call does not exceed a specified memory allocation limit. It works with memory allocation limits defined via `Allocation_limit.t` and source code positions from `Core_kernel`. A concrete use case is enforcing memory usage constraints in test cases to ensure performance expectations are met.",

It supports two constructors, `Major_words` and `Minor_words`, representing thresholds for major and minor heap allocations. It is used to configure and verify memory usage constraints in test cases.",

It enables serialization round-trip testing (bin-io, sexp), exception-safe evaluation, and configurable formatting of S-expressions or strings, while addressing use cases like position-aware error reporting, correctness requirement enforcement, and allocation-bound validation in test scenarios.",

It includes a function `sexp_of_t` for converting values of type `t` into S-expressions and `hide_unstable_output`, which determines whether output should be hidden based on the variant.

It supports use cases like stabilizing test expectations through precise s-expression rendering, verifying equality and exceptions, and integrating property-based testing with customizable CR (confirmation response) handling. The ability to override CR processing enables workflows such as aborting tests on first failure, enhancing diagnostic precision during test development.",
