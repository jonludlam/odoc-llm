It simplifies working with mutable variables in parallel incremental computations by providing concise syntax for common operations. These operators are used directly when updating and reading variables within computation graphs that track dependencies for efficient recomputation.",

It provides core operations like `watch` for observing changes and integrating variables into reactive systems, while its child module introduces `:=` and `!` operators for intuitive variable assignment and retrieval within computation graphs. Main data types include variables of any type `'a` that can be dynamically updated, with operations that ensure consistent and efficient recomputation. Example uses include building GUIs or dataflow pipelines where variables reactively update based on dependencies.",

It works with incremental values of type `'a Par_incr.incremental` and cutoff functions that determine when updates should be propagated. A typical use case is attaching a delta-based equality check to floating-point incrementals, avoiding unnecessary recomputation due to insignificant numerical differences.",
