Operates on `Var.t` type, enabling direct manipulation of mutable values. Used to simplify assignments and assertions in code that dynamically manages variable states.",

Works with incremental computation structures and values of arbitrary type. Used to manage termination in numerical algorithms where small value differences should not trigger a cutoff.",

Allows for concise updates and inspections in runtime environments. Example: `x := 5` assigns a new value, while `!x` retrieves the current value.",

Supports string conversion for detailed debugging of computational steps and offers syntactic constructs for composing incremental computations in sequence or parallel. Operations include mapping, binding, combining, and parallel execution of arbitrary type values. Examples include setting `x := 5`, retrieving `!x`, and combining computations into tuples or chained transformations.",
