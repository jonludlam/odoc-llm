Works with Redis connections and command responses, handling low-level communication. Useful for debugging Redis interactions or building custom command-line tools that interface with Redis databases.",

It works with Redis configuration parameters and process handles, enabling precise control over server lifecycle and settings. Use it to test Redis behavior under specific configurations or run isolated Redis instances for development.",

It works with Redis commands represented as string arrays or `Value.t` arrays, and manages client state, timeouts, and script execution. Concrete use cases include sending Redis commands like `SET` or `GET`, executing Lua scripts, and handling bulk data transfers over a Redis connection.",

It supports executing Redis commands via a shell-like interface and handles low-level communication, while also allowing users to start, stop, and configure standalone Redis server instances. Key data types include connection handles, command responses, and server process references. You can use it to debug Redis interactions, run custom command-line tools, or test Redis configurations in isolated environments.",

Typical use includes feeding network data incrementally and retrieving structured replies like integers, bulk strings, or arrays.",

It provides functions to create a pool with a specified size and to retrieve clients from the pool for executing Redis commands. Use it when handling multiple Redis requests across different fibers without exceeding server connection limits.",

      "description": "This module wraps the hiredis C library to enable direct interaction with Redis through protocol encoding and decoding, supporting command execution, response parsing, and connection management. It centers around the `Value.t` type for representing Redis values, with operations to send commands, handle replies, and manage client state, including support for pipelines, subscriptions, and Lua scripts. Submodules extend this functionality with client connection handling, server management, incremental response parsing, and connection pooling. Use it to build Redis clients, execute commands like `SET` or `GET`, manage Redis servers, parse streaming Redis responses, or coordinate concurrent access via connection pools.",
