It works with Redis commands as string arrays or pre-formatted Value.t arrays, supports command queuing, script loading, and execution with typed arguments. Concrete use cases include issuing Redis commands like GET or SET, loading and invoking Lua scripts with key and argument lists, and managing client-side timeouts and keepalive settings.",
