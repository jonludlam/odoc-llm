It operates on session types that model communication protocols and I/O operations wrapped in Lwt.

It handles choice between operations and manages I/O through Lwt, enabling precise control over parallel computations. Key data types include session channels and protocol descriptions, with operations for sending, receiving, and branching. Examples include implementing a chat protocol, coordinating distributed tasks, or building stateful services with explicit communication flows.",
