      "description": "This module directly handles data extraction from DBF files by providing functions to create typed readers for fields, supporting operations like converting field types to strings and retrieving values by index or name. It works with structured data types such as `dbf_file`, optional byte sequences, and primitive types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Specific use cases include reading typed values from specific positions in a DBF record, such as extracting an integer or string field by its name or index during data processing.",

It works with `dbf_file` records that include file channels, metadata, and current record positions, along with bitstrings representing individual records. Use cases include parsing legacy dBASE tables, extracting structured data, and implementing custom queries over dBASE files.",

It operates directly on DBF file handles and returns raw string data stored in memo fields. Use this module when parsing DBF files that use memo fields to store large text values externally.",
