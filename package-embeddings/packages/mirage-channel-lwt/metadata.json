It supports reading and writing individual characters, strings, and buffers, with functions for line-based I/O, exact byte counts, and buffered flushing. Use cases include network protocol implementations and file I/O where structured, buffered access to byte streams is required.",

It works with `Cstruct.t` buffers and a flow type from the parameter module, handling errors specific to reading and writing. Concrete use cases include efficient network stream processing and implementing protocols requiring framed or line-based communication.",

It uses `Cstruct.t` for memory-efficient data handling and integrates with a flow type to manage low-level communication. Examples include implementing network protocols, processing framed messages, and performing structured file I/O with precise control over data transmission.",
