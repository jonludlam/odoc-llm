Operates on raw byte arrays representing font data and returns structured information about characters and their shapes. Used to embed custom fonts in applications requiring precise text rendering and layout control.",

      "description": "The module offers low-level operations for parsing TrueType fonts, rendering glyphs as bitmaps, and calculating metrics, with a focus on rasterization, subpixel adjustments, and bounding box computations. It works with structured data like glyph metrics, packed character ranges, and bitmap quads, alongside font buffers and packing contexts to manage text rendering. Use cases include texture packing for UI elements, precise glyph positioning in game engines, and efficient font rendering in graphics applications.",
