It supports creating single or contiguous mappings with read or write access, and ensures proper cleanup with functions like `unmap` and `unmap_exn`. The child module extends this by handling local memory regions using `Io_page.t`, allowing retrieval of mapped buffers with `to_buf` and safe unmapping with result-returning operations. Together, they enable efficient and safe memory sharing in Xen guests, such as for device drivers or inter-VM communication.",
