It works with a custom `t` type representing precision-configurable floats and `Q.t` for rational conversions, enabling tasks such as numerical computation and value classification. Specific use cases include high-precision calculations, numerical analysis, and categorizing floating-point properties via `Classify.t` outputs.",

Supports set-like operations such as intersection, addition, and range queries using `ge`, `gt`, `le`, and `lt`. Works with `t` to represent intervals, enabling creation of single-element intervals via `singleton` and checking for singleton status with `is_singleton`.",

It defines abstract types for rounding modes, floating-point classes, arbitrary-precision floats, and intervals, each with comparison, hashing, and formatting capabilities. Users can perform high-precision calculations, classify float properties, and manage ranges with operations like intersection and singleton checks. Examples include converting floats to rationals, comparing classifications, and constructing intervals for numerical analysis.",
