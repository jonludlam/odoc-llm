      "description": "The module provides predicate and classification functions for evaluating Unicode characters, focusing on properties like ASCII, CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean), and specific subsets such as digits, letters, and whitespace. It operates on Unicode code points (uchar) to determine character categories, including control, printable, and block-specific ranges. Use cases include text validation, localization tasks, and parsing scenarios requiring precise character property checks.",

It defines a `buf` type for mutable text storage and provides methods for appending, concatenating, and modifying content. Users can construct complex strings incrementally, process Unicode characters, and efficiently manage large text outputs. Examples include building HTML snippets, logging formatted messages, or parsing structured text streams.",

It supports functional operations such as mapping, folding, and filtering, alongside conversions between UTF-8 strings and ASCII or list-based representations. Specific use cases include processing internationalized text, preparing data for linguistic analysis, and ensuring consistent encoding in multilingual applications.",
