It works with abstract syntax trees and environment states to enable embedding scripting capabilities and building domain-specific language interpreters. The interpreter manages Lua values through a `value` type representing numbers, strings, functions, and tables, and uses a hash-based table module for key-value storage with efficient lookups and iteration. Additional support for mapping Lua values to OCaml data types enables structured parsing and bidirectional transformations, while a bytecode runtime allows custom instruction sets and fine-grained control over execution semantics.",
