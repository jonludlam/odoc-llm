It works with abstract types for tasks, timeouts, and event sources, enabling precise control over I/O and timing in cooperative multitasking systems such as network servers and clients. A key submodule implements efficient polling of file descriptors, letting clients register and wait for I/O events like read or write readiness, which is essential for handling concurrent network connections. Together, these components allow developers to build responsive, event-driven applications with fine-grained control over system resources.",

It works with concrete event types that specify read, write, or combined readiness, and selects the most efficient I/O multiplexing backend available on the system. Clients can use it to build event-driven network servers and clients that handle concurrent connections efficiently. Timeout behavior is controlled through explicit timeout values that determine whether polling should return immediately, wait indefinitely, or delay for a specified duration.",
