It handles event states with a record type for I/O readiness, processes structured requests with a command type, and manages timeouts using a custom time type. It enables efficient handling of network connections, execution of API commands, and scheduling of delayed actions. Examples include detecting readable file descriptors, parsing and responding to API requests, and triggering actions after a set interval.",
