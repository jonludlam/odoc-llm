It defines a polymorphic `command` type representing IRC operations (e.g., authentication, channel management, messaging) with associated data, paired with an optional prefix in the `t` type. Designed for tasks like protocol implementation, message validation, and network communication, it operates on raw strings, channels, and buffers to convert between wire format and typed representations.",

It offers functions for splitting strings and managing buffered socket data, alongside structured logging for errors, warnings, and debug information. You can use it to break down raw IRC input into lines, accumulate partial messages, and log connection events or parsing issues with context. Together, these features support robust, traceable handling of IRC communication.",
