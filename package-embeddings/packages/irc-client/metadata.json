It works with connection state, IRC messages, and network addresses to support building persistent, event-driven IRC clients. Concrete use cases include automated chat bots, real-time messaging integrations, and network monitoring tools that require reliable IRC communication.",

It supports logging operations that integrate with `Logs.Tag.set` and custom formatters, enabling structured and contextual logging. The module includes utilities for handling and logging `result`-valued computations, specifically for surfacing and formatting `Error` cases with customizable severity levels and message handlers.",

It operates on strings and message structures to handle common IRC commands like authentication, channel joining, and private messaging, supporting use cases such as client-server communication or message routing. Helper functions simplify creating commands with variable arguments, optional values, or list-based parameters while providing robust parsing and wire-format serialization.",
