Users can construct complex domains like products of boxes and booleans, perform arithmetic and logical operations with safe error handling, and model uncertain truth values using three-valued logic. Specific applications include static analysis of programs, formal verification, and solving constraint satisfaction problems with customizable precision and output visualization.",
