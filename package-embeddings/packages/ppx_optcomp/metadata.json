Works with token lists and attribute-bearing AST nodes, using environment values to determine which code paths to include or exclude. Used during preprocessing to handle `[@@if]`, `[@@else]`, and similar attributes in OCaml source files.",

It operates on OCaml AST types like `Ppxlib.expression`, `Ppxlib.payload`, and `Ppxlib.longident_loc`. These utilities are used to process extension nodes in ppx rewriters, such as parsing arguments to attributes or handling conditional compilation constructs.",

It includes submodules that manage value representations for compile-time conditions, extract and construct AST elements from payloads, maintain variable bindings for evaluation, and convert AST nodes into token streams with location and attribute information. Main data types include environment mappings, interpreter values for primitive types, token lists, and annotated AST elements, with operations to evaluate conditions, build expressions from values, and traverse or modify syntax trees. Examples include rewriting code based on system properties like OCaml version, expanding conditional attributes such as `[@@if]`, and generating expressions from bound variables during preprocessing.",
