      "description": "Supports reading data from files and input channels with support for binary and text modes, including line-by-line processing, random access via position manipulation, and efficient bulk reads into bigarrays or buffers. Works directly with input channels, files, and bigarray-backed buffers, offering safe resource management through scoped opening functions and platform-specific handling for cross-environment consistency. Ideal for tasks like parsing structured binary formats, streaming large text files, or implementing custom file traversal logic with controlled seek operations.",

Its submodules extend channel management with precise control over input and output operations, supporting binary serialization, line-by-line parsing, and efficient buffer handling. Specific capabilities include splitting strings, safely writing to files with custom cleanup, and converting exceptions to readable strings for logging. Together, they enable robust text processing, structured file I/O, and clearer error diagnostics.",
