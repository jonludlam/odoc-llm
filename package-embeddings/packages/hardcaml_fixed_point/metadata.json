It provides core data types representing fixed-point values with explicit integer and fractional bit widths, processed using bit vectors and convertible to floating-point. The module allows operations like addition, multiplication, and scaling by powers of two with boundary checks, while submodules define rounding modes and overflow strategies such as saturation or wrapping. These features facilitate the design of hardware-synthesizable numeric circuits and signal processing pipelines with strict control over precision and overflow behavior.",

It includes utilities for converting to and from floating-point, normalizing precision, and multiplexing signals, making it suitable for digital signal processing and hardware synthesis where exact numerical control is essential. The rounding submodule offers modes like round-to-nearest even, round-toward-zero, and round-to-infinity, while the overflow submodule provides `wrap` and `saturate` strategies to manage out-of-bounds behavior in bit vector computations. Examples include resizing a fixed-point signal with saturation on overflow and rounding to nearest even, or scaling a value by a power of two while preserving sign and precision.",
