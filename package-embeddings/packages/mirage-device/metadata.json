It provides abstract device types and error variants like `Unimplemented` and `Disconnected`, along with functions to handle state transitions and cleanly terminate connections. The `disconnect` function allows safe resource release during device lifecycle management. Together, they enable implementing device drivers and coordinating device behavior in unikernels.",
