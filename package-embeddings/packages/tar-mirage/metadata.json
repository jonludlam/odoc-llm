      "description": "This module implements a read-write key-value interface for managing data stored in tar-formatted block devices, supporting operations like key-based reads, writes, partial updates, and allocation while enforcing append-only semantics. It works with string values and keys represented as `Mirage_kv.Key.t`, tracking metadata such as modification timestamps and content digests, and interacts directly with block devices via the `connect` and `free` functions. It is designed for MirageOS applications requiring lightweight storage management over immutable tar archives, such as unikernels needing to append or modify files in a constrained environment where deletions or renames are disallowed.",

It supports operations such as checking key existence, retrieving full or partial values, listing directory entries, and querying metadata like size, last modified time, and digest. It works with block devices and uses standard Mirage key-value types, making it suitable for embedding static file hierarchies in unikernels.",
