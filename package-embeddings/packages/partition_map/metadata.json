It supports iterative traversal, cross-index pair generation, and interval pairing, leveraging arithmetic and set theory principles. These functionalities are tailored for efficient processing in contexts like Prohlatype, where handling overlapping or adjacent ranges requires precise control over integer domains.",

Works with lists of interval objects, where each interval represents a range of integers. Used to efficiently determine if a point lies within any interval and to split sets into overlapping and non-overlapping regions.",

Works with a parameterized type 'a t that supports equality checks for insertion. Used to build partition maps in descending order before converting them to ascending order for merging with other structures.",

It works with ordered interval structures and custom transformation logic, supporting tasks such as range-based data processing or dynamic interval management. Specific use cases include scenarios requiring bidirectional interval mapping, like financial time-series analysis or spatial data partitioning.",
