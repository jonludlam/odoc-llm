Key capabilities include merging multiple interval maps, mapping functions over ranges, converting between ordered representations (e.g., ascending to descending), and efficiently handling use cases like range-based data aggregation, memory layout management, or temporal interval analysis where ordered partitions must be preserved or combined.",

It works with partitioned data structures where ordering is significant, particularly when merging requires conversion to ascending order. Concrete use cases include maintaining ordered partitions during data processing tasks where descending insertion is more efficient.",

It supports operations like merging, mapping functions over intervals, and converting between ascending and descending representations, with specific use in range aggregation, memory layout, and temporal analysis. The module handles both interval sets and value-labeled partitions, allowing membership checks, intersections, and ordered insertion, particularly useful for tracking time slots, memory regions, or ordered data partitions. Examples include merging overlapping memory ranges, converting interval orderings, and aggregating data across time intervals.",
