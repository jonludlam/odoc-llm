It works with elements of any type `'a` and maintains them in descending order based on a provided equality function. Concrete use cases include efficiently managing and merging ordered partitions, particularly when constructing them incrementally before converting to ascending order for final processing.",

It works directly with lists of `Interval.t` values, treating them as sets with unique, non-overlapping intervals. Concrete use cases include managing ranges of integers where overlaps must be resolved, such as tracking allocated memory blocks or scheduling time slots.",

It works with intervals represented as bounded integer ranges and provides transformations to index pairs for structured traversal or mapping tasks. These capabilities are useful for managing disjoint or contiguous regions in algorithms requiring efficient range partitioning, such as memory allocation or interval tree implementations.",

It works with partition maps that associate intervals to values, emphasizing functional composition through operations like `cpair` for pairwise element combination and equivalence checks. These capabilities are useful for interval arithmetic, range-based data aggregation, or scenarios requiring efficient coalescing of ordered, non-overlapping segments.",
