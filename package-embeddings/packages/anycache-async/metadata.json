It works with a user-defined key type `K.t` and stores values of type `'a` within a cache instance. Use cases include reducing redundant async computations, such as fetching remote data or expensive on-demand processing, by caching results and reusing them until evicted.",

It provides `return` and `fail` for creating monadic values from results or exceptions, and the `>>?` operator for chaining operations that depend on the success or failure of prior steps. It is used to structure async workflows where each step can either continue on success or handle errors explicitly, such as in asynchronous cache lookups or network requests with fallback logic.",
