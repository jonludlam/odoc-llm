It provides functions to create a cache with a specified capacity, retrieve cached values, set values directly, and compute or validate values asynchronously on demand. This module is useful for reducing redundant async computations, such as fetching remote data or performing expensive I/O operations, by caching results based on keys.",

It provides `return` and `fail` to create successful or failed results, and `>>?` to chain operations that process results or handle errors. Useful for building async workflows where each step depends on the outcome of the previous, such as fetching and processing remote data with fallbacks on failure.",

      "description": "This module integrates async workflows with a key-based caching layer, enabling efficient handling of asynchronous computations that can fail. It centers around a cache structure with keys of type `K.t` and values of type `'a`, supporting async retrieval, storage, and validation, along with a result monad for chaining operations and propagating errors. Operations include creating caches with bounded capacity, setting and getting values, and defining async compute and validate functions. For example, it can cache the result of fetching remote data keyed by URL, reusing prior results or computing anew when expired or invalid, while handling I/O errors cleanly within async pipelines.",
