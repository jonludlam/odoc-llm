It provides direct access to fields such as `name`, `has_arg`, `flag`, and `_val`, enabling interaction with C-compatible option definitions. Concrete use cases include building custom command-line interfaces that interface with C libraries or system APIs requiring `getopt_long`-style option parsing.",

      "description": "This module provides a structured interface for working with POSIX `option` records, primarily for parsing command-line arguments in a way that interoperates with C libraries. It exposes direct access to key fields such as `name`, `has_arg`, `flag`, and `_val`, allowing precise control over option definitions. Operations include creating, modifying, and querying options to support custom command-line interfaces. For example, it enables defining an option that, when passed, sets a flag or stores a value for further processing in an application.",

      "description": "This module offers a structured interface for defining and manipulating POSIX `option` records to parse command-line arguments with C-style interoperability. It centers around a core data type representing an option, with fields such as `name`, `has_arg`, `flag`, and `_val`, supporting precise configuration of argument behavior. Operations allow creating and modifying options to control whether they accept no, optional, or required arguments, and to specify how they update program state. For instance, it can define an option `-v` that increments a verbosity counter or `--output` that captures a filename for later use.",

It works with arrays of strings as input and manipulates them based on a list of option definitions that specify flags, optional arguments, or required arguments.

It supports options that act as flags, switches, or accept arguments, with direct integration into C libraries for argument parsing. Users can define option specifications, associate them with variables or values, and parse command-line input to configure applications or utilities, such as enabling verbose mode with `-v` or specifying a file path with `-f`. Example usage includes building system tools that require flexible and standard command-line interfaces.",
