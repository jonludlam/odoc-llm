It works directly with HTML nodes and sequences, offering precise access to elements via CSS selection, traversal, and property extraction. Use this when you expect a specific HTML structure and need to enforce the presence of elements, attributes, or text, such as extracting the first paragraph of an article or verifying a page title.",
