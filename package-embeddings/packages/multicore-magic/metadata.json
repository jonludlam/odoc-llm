It supports atomic compare-and-swap, direct reads, and writes without memory fences, targeting high-performance concurrent applications. Use cases include lock-free data structures and synchronization primitives where fine-grained memory control is required.",

      "description": "This module provides atomic operations for shared-memory concurrency, including `get`, `set`, `exchange`, `compare_and_set`, and `fetch_and_add`, with optimized handling for arrays of atomic values. It works directly with the type `'a t`, represented as a private reference type to enable efficient compilation, particularly avoiding unnecessary float-related code generation. It is suitable for high-performance concurrent data structures such as lock-free counters, atomic flags, and synchronized state in multicore applications.",

      "description": "This module offers low-level utilities for optimizing multicore OCaml performance, including memory padding to prevent false sharing, direct atomic operations without memory fences, and index allocation for domains. It works with atomic values, arrays, and domain-specific identifiers, enabling efficient shared-memory concurrency and fine-grained synchronization. Concrete use cases include implementing lock-free data structures, high-performance counters, and thread-safe state management with minimal overhead.",
