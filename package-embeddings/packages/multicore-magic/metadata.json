It supports atomic compare-and-swap, direct reads, and writes at specific indices, working with any type `'a` that can be stored atomically, including unboxed values. It is used in high-performance concurrent algorithms where fine-grained synchronization and lock-free operations on array elements are required.",

It works with atomic references of type `'a t`, particularly optimized for arrays of atomic integers. It is used to implement efficient, thread-safe counters, synchronization primitives, and lock-free data structures in multicore OCaml programs.",

      "description": "This module offers low-level utilities for optimizing multicore OCaml programs through memory layout control, atomic operations, and domain indexing. It enables creation of padded data structures to prevent false sharing, direct access to atomic values without memory fences, and generation of unique domain indices for contention avoidance. The module supports high-performance concurrent data structures and lock-free algorithms, with concrete operations on atomic integers and arrays. Submodules extend this capability with specialized atomic arrays and optimized atomic reference operations, enabling efficient thread-safe counters and fine-grained synchronization on shared memory.",
