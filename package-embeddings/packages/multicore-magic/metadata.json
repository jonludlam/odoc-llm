Works with a private reference type that enables more efficient array handling and prevents compiler optimizations that violate the memory model. Used to safely manage shared state in concurrent programs and improve performance in array-based atomic operations.",

Works with arrays of arbitrary OCaml values, including unboxed types when supported by the runtime.

It includes operations like compare-and-set, fetch-and-add, and atomic updates on private references and arrays. Users can implement thread-safe data structures, synchronization primitives, and high-performance concurrent algorithms. Examples include atomic counters, lock-free queues, and parallel array updates with controlled memory visibility.",
