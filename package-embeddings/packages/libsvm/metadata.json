It works with labeled datasets represented as arrays of sparse vectors or Lacaml dense vectors, enabling concrete applications such as text classification and numerical regression. The module includes a submodule for managing SVM models, allowing inspection of properties like type, labels, and support vectors, as well as loading, saving, and retrieving statistics. Another submodule encapsulates SVM problem instances, supporting creation, loading, saving, and scaling of training data in both sparse and dense formats.",
