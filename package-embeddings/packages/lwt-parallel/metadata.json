Works with arbitrary data types through provided put and get functions, or with serializable types via the built-in marshaling protocol. Used to transmit structured data over network connections or file streams with precise control over encoding and decoding.",

Works with Lwt promises, Unix sockets, and marshaled function definitions to ensure safe process creation. Enables parallel execution of I/O-bound tasks without thread interference or memory duplication.",

Supports transmitting structured data over channels with precise control over encoding and decoding. Enables execution of Lwt computations in separate processes, allowing asynchronous operations like remote I/O or distributed processing. For example, values can be sent to another process for computation or output, such as printing a string in a different process.",
