      "description": "This module defines the version-stable representation of response updates for polling-based RPCs, ensuring efficient transmission of small diffs instead of full responses. It provides serialization functions for converting update values to and from binary and S-expression formats, specifically tailored for use in a client-server communication context where response size is large relative to changes. The module works directly with the `Unstable.Update.t` type, exposing low-level bin_prot readers and writers optimized for performance in networked applications.",

It works with `Unstable.t` and `Stable.t` types, providing binary serialization functions and diff generation/update application operations. Concrete use cases include optimizing network bandwidth in client-server applications where responses are large but changes between them are small.",
