It supports configuration through control commands like setting bitrate, signal type, and VBR mode, and works with PCM audio data in both regular and Bigarray formats. It encodes audio frames into Ogg packets, suitable for VoIP, music streaming, or low-latency broadcast applications.",

It works with types like `Ogg.Stream.packet`, `Ogg.Stream.t`, and both regular and Bigarray float arrays for output. Use cases include streaming audio playback, real-time voice communication, and file transcoding where Opus-encoded data needs to be converted to raw audio samples.",

It manages encoder settings like bitrate and signal type, and exposes decoder features such as forward-error-correction and bandwidth detection, operating on PCM and Bigarray data. You can encode live audio into Ogg packets for VoIP, decode Opus streams into float PCM for playback, and adapt bandwidth dynamically during transmission. The API supports both low-level control via commands and high-level streaming interfaces through integrated Ogg packet handling.",
