It operates on byte slices (`Slice_bytes.t`) and strings, providing direct control over binary data representation and memory layout. These capabilities are particularly useful for tasks like binary file parsing, network protocol implementation, and systems programming where exact memory management is critical.",

It supports creating, modifying, and inspecting slices, with submodules enabling low-level byte operations, such as setting values, copying data, and handling endianness for multi-byte integers. You can parse binary formats, serialize data structures, or work on specific buffer regions without copying. Example uses include implementing network protocols and processing file formats like PNG or ELF.",

It handles binary data structured as contiguous byte sequences, supporting tasks like protocol parsing, file format manipulation, and memory overlap detection without intermediate allocations. Key features include zero-copy substring extraction, direct memory inspection, and bitwise data transformation for binary file or network stream processing.",
