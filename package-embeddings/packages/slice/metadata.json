It works directly with slice views into byte buffers, supporting in-place modifications, memory overlap checks, and conversions to standard strings, making it suitable for binary protocol parsing, serialization, and low-level data structure manipulation where direct memory access and performance are critical.",

It provides functions to create, shift, and inspect slices, along with printing support via the Format module. Concrete use cases include efficient parsing and serialization of binary data formats and implementing memory-efficient views into large buffers.",
