It handles errors such as occurs checks and term mismatches, supporting use cases in type inference and symbolic manipulation. The substitution module manages variable bindings during unification, offering operations to query, list, and display substitutions, using variables and terms from the associated `Abt` implementation. Together, they enable precise term rewriting and constraint solving under variable substitution.",
