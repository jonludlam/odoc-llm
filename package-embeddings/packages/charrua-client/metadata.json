It returns a stream of lease packets, where each lease contains the configuration data received from the server. It is used to acquire dynamic IP addresses and network settings from a DHCP server, with control over whether to renew the lease automatically.",

It exposes a stream-based interface for receiving lease updates, where each lease includes network configuration details such as IP address, subnet mask, and gateway. Users can control automatic lease renewal and inspect configuration data as it changes over time. Example usage includes monitoring lease changes or configuring network interfaces dynamically based on received DHCP responses.",

It works with MAC addresses, transaction IDs, and DHCP wire-format packets, producing formatted output and handling responses to progress lease negotiations. Use it to implement a DHCP client that can initiate lease requests, process server responses, and renew existing leases.",

It works with network devices conforming to the `Network` module type and handles DHCP request configuration through optional parameters. Concrete use cases include initializing network interfaces in MirageOS unikernels to acquire dynamic IP configuration for IPv4 connectivity.",

It provides core operations for processing incoming IP frames, constructing outgoing IP headers, selecting source addresses, generating pseudoheaders, and managing MTU constraints. It enables integration of IPv4 with higher-level protocols like TCP and UDP. Example usage includes sending and receiving IP packets, handling fragmented frames, and binding to specific source addresses for transmission.",
