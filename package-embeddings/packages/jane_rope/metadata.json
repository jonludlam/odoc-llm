It works directly with the `Rope.t` type, which represents strings as a tree structure for efficient concatenation. These functions are useful for debugging, testing correctness, and handling large string data without excessive memory allocation.",

      "description": "The module implements a rope data structure that represents strings as a tree for efficient concatenation and traversal, supporting operations like `^`, to_string, and prefix checks. It enables incremental character processing via sequences and avoids costly string copies, ideal for text editing or log aggregation. The child module adds inspection and testing tools, such as converting ropes to S-expressions, counting base nodes, and tail-recursive string conversion. Together, they provide a complete interface for building, manipulating, and analyzing ropes both in application logic and testing scenarios.",
