Works with Lwt's thread-based concurrency model and OpenSSL's SSL context and connection structures. Used to implement secure network communication in applications requiring non-blocking, concurrent data exchange over encrypted channels.",

      "description": "This module enables secure communication through SSL/TLS by offering functions for creating and managing encrypted sockets, handling handshake protocols for client and server roles, and performing asynchronous read/write operations on network connections. It works with Lwt-based sockets, Unix file descriptors, and low-level socket types to facilitate secure data transmission and network management. Use cases include building encrypted client-server applications, integrating TLS into asynchronous I/O workflows, and fine-grained control over SSL socket lifecycle and underlying file descriptors.",
