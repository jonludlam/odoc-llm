It supports polymorphic comparisons through type-specific functions (e.g., `compare_int`, `equal_string`) and higher-order combinators that delegate to user-defined comparators for parametric types. These utilities are typically leveraged by ppx rewriters to auto-generate efficient equality and ordering logic for custom algebraic data types.",
