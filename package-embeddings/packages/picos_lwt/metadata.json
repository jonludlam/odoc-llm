Works with Picos.Fiber.t and Lwt.t types to manage asynchronous execution and cancellation. Enables running main programs as fibers, capturing results, and controlling cancellation propagation in a direct style.",

Operates with `float` for sleep durations and `trigger` objects for synchronization. Used to coordinate tasks across threads, implement timeouts, and manage event-driven workflows in Lwt-based applications.",
