It supports running computations in a fiber-aware context, capturing results, and enforcing execution policies via the `forbid` flag. Concrete use cases include building and executing concurrent network services or system utilities that require fine-grained control over asynchronous effects and fiber scheduling.",

      "description": "This module provides direct-style functions for working with Lwt promises and fibers, including `await` for synchronously waiting on promises, and `run_fiber` and `run` for executing fibers under the Lwt scheduler. It operates on Lwt promises (`'a Lwt.t`) and Picos fibers (`Picos.Fiber.t`), integrating them with the Lwt runtime. Concrete use cases include writing asynchronous programs in a direct style without manually chaining Lwt callbacks, and embedding Picos fibers into an Lwt-based concurrency model.",
