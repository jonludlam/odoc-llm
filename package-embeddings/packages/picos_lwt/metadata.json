      "description": "This module provides functions to execute Picos fibers using the Lwt scheduler with Lwt_unix, enabling asynchronous I/O operations in OCaml 5. It directly integrates Picos' fiber model with Lwt's promise-based concurrency, allowing seamless interleaving of Lwt and Picos code. Concrete use cases include building network servers or clients that combine Lwt-based I/O with Picos-style cooperative multitasking.",

      "description": "This module provides concurrency primitives for managing asynchronous operations with Lwt in a system-independent manner. It includes functions for creating and managing sleep delays, thread-safe triggers, and promises that resolve when triggers are signaled. These operations are useful for coordinating asynchronous tasks, such as implementing timeouts, one-time notifications, or synchronization barriers in concurrent programs.",

      "description": "This module integrates Lwt's cooperative concurrency with Picos fibers, offering direct-style primitives like `await` and `run` to write and execute asynchronous workflows seamlessly. It bridges Lwt promises (`'a Lwt.t`) with Picos fibers, enabling structured concurrency for tasks such as network servers and clients where Lwt handles scheduling. Submodules provide utilities like sleep, triggers, and promises for coordination patterns including timeouts and synchronization barriers, all without relying on system-specific features.",
