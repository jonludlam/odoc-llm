      "description": "This module manages polyhedral computations with operations for setting up and tearing down a context, configuring garbage collection and widening strategies, and converting between various representations of constraints and expressions. It works with dimensions, constraints, and generators, using big integers for precision, and provides functions to format and print lists of structured data. Concrete use cases include manipulating convex polyhedra in program analysis, such as transforming constraints into readable strings or exporting polyhedra in a specific format.",

      "description": "The module offers operations to manipulate mutable matrices, including setting/retrieving integer or string values at specific indices, managing rows and columns via vector interactions, sorting, merging, and structural transformations like dimension adjustments and permutations. It supports constraint-solving workflows by enabling symbolic variable substitution, equation-based transformations, and constraint printing, often leveraging vectors and dimension specifications. These capabilities are suited for tasks requiring dynamic matrix restructuring and symbolic computation, such as optimization or formal verification systems.",

It operates on lexical structures defined by the `Polka_parser.token` type, transforming raw input into structured tokens. It is used to tokenize source code during parsing, enabling the parser to interpret language constructs.",

It works with vectors that track dimension metadata (`dimsup`) and use arbitrary-precision integers, enabling precise numerical analysis in constrained spaces. This is useful for applications like cryptographic algorithms requiring large integer arithmetic or data transformation pipelines needing dynamic vector reconfiguration.",

It works with polyhedra represented as `Poly.t` values, alongside vectors, matrices, and constraint lists, enabling use cases like program analysis and computational geometry. Key functionalities include lazy evaluation for structural queries (e.g., emptiness checks), widening for approximation, and set-theoretic operations (unions, intersections) to combine polyhedral regions.",
