      "description": "This module orchestrates the compilation of Eliom applications by resolving dependencies and transforming Eliom source files into executables or libraries, leveraging custom data structures for module signatures and build contexts. It collaborates with path-handling utilities to manage directory layouts and integrates with a dispatcher that automates build workflows using Ocamlbuild's plugin architecture. You can compile client-server Eliom applications, partition code between client and server, and produce optimized JavaScript output while organizing source and build directories according to project needs. The API supports direct manipulation of build configurations and compilation contexts, alongside submodules that handle path resolution and dispatching build tasks.",

It allows registration of dispatch hooks to control routing and service initialization, using `Ocamlbuild_plugin.hook` and path lists for executable-specific setup. Key data types include string constants for server, client, and type directories, which are used to reference source and output locations during the build. Example uses include customizing request handling and organizing build artifacts across different environments.",
