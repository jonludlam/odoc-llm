      "description": "The module provides functional set operations for managing and querying collections of strings, including adding, removing, combining elements, and performing inspections like min/max retrieval, splitting, and predicate-based searches. It works with a set data structure (type `t`) where elements are strings (type `elt`), enabling efficient traversal and transformation for tasks such as dynamic data management or complex query filtering. Specific use cases include maintaining unique string collections, analyzing set properties, and deriving new sets through conditional operations.",
