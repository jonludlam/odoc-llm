      "description": "This module offers parsers for common language tokens, including string/character literals, delimiters (parentheses, braces, etc.), and separator-separated lists (e.g., commas, semicolons), while managing whitespace according to specified rules. It processes input streams to extract numeric values (decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary, floating-point) in OCaml-style formats, ensuring proper error handling for invalid or out-of-range values. These utilities are essential for building language parsers, handling structured data, and processing formatted text with strict tokenization requirements.",

It manipulates byte sequences (bytes type) for operations like string conversion, UTF-8/UTF-16 decoding, and direct memory access, often mirroring string operations but with risks to immutability if misused. Specific use cases include network protocol parsing, file format serialization, and performance-critical data manipulation where direct byte-level control is required.",
