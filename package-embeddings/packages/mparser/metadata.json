      "library": "mparser",
      "description": "This module provides functions for parsing common lexical elements in programming languages, such as delimited expressions, punctuation, numeric literals, and string or character tokens with escape sequences. It operates on character streams, automatically handling whitespace after tokens, and converts input into OCaml values like integers, floats, and strings. These parsers are particularly useful for implementing compilers, interpreters, or data processors that require precise tokenization of structured text, including support for multiple numeric bases and OCaml-style literal syntax.",

A typical use case involves parsing data from files or network streams where precise control over input buffering is required.",

It operates on character streams and regular expressions represented by the `Regexp.t` type. A concrete use case is parsing structured text formats like log files or configuration files where pattern-based extraction from a stream is needed.",

      "description": "This module integrates regular expressions into a monadic parser combinator framework, enabling parsing operations that match input against patterns and return matched strings or substrings. It works with character streams and parser states, supporting use cases like lexing structured text, extracting tokens, and building custom parsers for domain-specific languages. The child module extends this functionality by providing parsers for common lexical elements\u2014such as numbers, strings, and punctuation\u2014with automatic whitespace handling and conversion to OCaml values like integers and floats, making it suitable for compilers, interpreters, and data processors. Together, they allow combining regex-based parsing with precise tokenization and value extraction in a unified parsing pipeline.",

It operates on mutable `bytes` buffers and strings, supporting transformations like case conversion, substring searches, and UTF-8/UTF-16BE/LE validation. Key use cases include handling binary file formats, network protocol implementations, and low-level data processing requiring precise byte-level control.",

It enables efficient parsing of large files (up to 1GB), structured text like arithmetic expressions, and custom domain-specific languages, with precise error messages and state management for position tracking and user-defined data. The integrated child module adds regex-based parsing and utilities for tokenization, extracting values like integers and floats, and handling common lexical elements with automatic whitespace management.
