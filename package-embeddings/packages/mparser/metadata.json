      "library": "mparser",
      "description": "This module provides parsers for common syntactic tokens in programming languages, including symbols, parentheses, braces, numeric literals (decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary, and floating-point), and OCaml-style string/character literals with escape sequences. It operates on character streams, automatically skipping trailing whitespace after tokens unless explicitly controlled, and converts parsed input into structured types like integers, floats, or strings while enforcing syntax rules (e.g., rejecting invalid numeric formats or overflow). These parsers are particularly useful for implementing language grammars, expression evaluators, or data format parsers where precise tokenization and whitespace handling are required, such as parsing mathematical expressions, configuration files, or OCaml-like source code.",

It includes the `input` function, which reads a specified number of bytes from an input channel into a buffer at a given position, returning the actual number of bytes read. It is useful for efficient, direct manipulation of input streams in parsing or data processing tasks.",

      "description": "This module offers low-level byte sequence operations for binary data parsing, ASCII text processing, and encoding manipulation. It works directly with mutable `bytes` values to enable efficient integer serialization/deserialization (with configurable endianness), ASCII-aware character transformations (case conversion, trimming, predicate checks), and UTF-8/UTF-16 encoding validation. Typical use cases include network protocol implementation, binary file format parsing, and performance-critical text processing where in-place byte manipulation is required.",

      "description": "This module integrates regular expression matching into a monadic parser combinator framework, providing parsers that consume input based on compiled regex patterns. It supports operations to match regex against the current input stream, extract full matches or individual substrings, and construct parsers directly from regex expressions. Concrete use cases include parsing structured text formats like log files, extracting tokens with complex patterns from source code, and validating or decomposing strings according to specific formats (e.g., URLs, timestamps, or identifiers).",

It primarily works with `string` and `bytes` types, emphasizing low-level character encoding (UTF-8/16) and binary data parsing through functions like `split_on_char`, `mapi`, and endianness-aware integer decoding. Its utilities are suited for text processing, binary format parsing, and encoding validation tasks requiring direct byte-level manipulation.",
