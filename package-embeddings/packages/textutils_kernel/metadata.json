It provides functions for serialization and deserialization in binary and S-expression formats, along with basic comparison and conversion to and from standard OCaml strings. Concrete use cases include persisting UTF-8 text in binary formats, transmitting structured text over networks, and ensuring consistent text handling in data models that require stable serialization.",

It emphasizes character-level manipulation through functions like splitting text, measuring display width, and searching via `find_map` or `exists`, which are critical for applications requiring precise Unicode handling, such as internationalized text analysis, terminal rendering, or parsing protocols where byte-level operations would obscure character semantics.",

It works with `Text_block.t` and a boxed type to represent structured text layouts. Concrete use cases include formatting tabular data with borders, aligning multi-line text blocks, and generating visually separated sections in terminal output.",

It works with text blocks and lists parameterized by their length, ensuring alignment operations preserve the structure's shape. Concrete use cases include formatting fixed-size tables or aligned UI components where maintaining consistent dimensions is critical.",
