It provides standard atomic operations like `get`, `set`, `exchange`, `compare_and_set`, and `fetch_and_add`, along with specialized spawning and checking primitives for concurrent simulation. It is used to model and verify concurrent algorithms with precise memory behavior and thread interactions.",

It includes functions to convert operations to strings, determine if an operation may modify memory (with optional handling of indeterminate cases), and compare operations for weak equivalence. It is used to model and analyze concurrency behaviors in lock-free data structures.",
