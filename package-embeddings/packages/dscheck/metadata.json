It provides operations to add, clear, compare, and print traces, as well as extract dependency information and count entries. Use cases include debugging concurrent operations and analyzing operation dependencies in distributed systems.",

It works with generic values `'a` and specialized integer operations for counters, including memory-contended allocation to prevent false sharing. Concrete use cases include implementing synchronization primitives, concurrent data structures, and writing test cases for race conditions under simulated scheduling.",

It provides functions to convert operations to strings, determine if an operation is a write, and compare operations for weak equivalence. These operations model concurrency primitives used in shared-memory systems to implement thread-safe data structures and synchronization mechanisms.",

It tracks sequences of atomic operations with dependencies, supports thread-safe state manipulation through atomic references, and defines operations like `get`, `set`, and `compare_and_swap` for synchronization. You can use it to debug concurrent systems, simulate race conditions, or build thread-safe data structures with precise control over memory operations. For example, you can trace dependencies in a distributed workflow, implement a concurrent counter with atomic increments, or verify weak equivalence between memory operations.",
