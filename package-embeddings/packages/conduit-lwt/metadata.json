It supports service functions that resolve hostnames, rewrite functions that modify URIs based on hosts, and composition of service logic. Use cases include configuring custom URI resolution pipelines, applying domain-specific rewrite rules, and integrating with network clients that require endpoint resolution.",

      "description": "This module resolves URIs to endpoints using Lwt for asynchronous I/O, supporting custom resolution pipelines through resolvers, service functions, and rewrite rules. It provides data types `t` for resolver state, `svc` for services, and `rewrite_fn`/`service_fn` to transform URIs or endpoints, enabling use cases like routing through proxies or mapping domains to specific endpoints. The child modules extend this with Lwt-based IO operations compatible with Conduit.IO, allowing asynchronous DNS resolution and socket connection management. Together, they support composing complex, domain-specific resolution logic and integrating with network clients requiring endpoint resolution.",
