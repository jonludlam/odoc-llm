It supports safe/unsafe conversion patterns for data interoperability, enabling tasks such as parsing IP addresses, managing coordinate systems, and handling time-based data. Use cases include mapping database outputs to OCaml types for structured processing and ensuring type-safe interactions with PostgreSQL's extended data formats.",
