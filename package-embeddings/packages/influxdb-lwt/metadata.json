It operates on network addresses and lists of time-series data points, using the Lwt concurrency library for asynchronous I/O. Concrete use cases include health-checking an InfluxDB instance and ingesting metrics or sensor data into a specified database.",

It works with network addresses and lists of data points, leveraging Lwt for non-blocking I/O. You can use it to check the health of an InfluxDB instance or send metrics like sensor readings to a specific database. For example, you might send a heartbeat ping or batch-upload CPU usage statistics at regular intervals.",
