It includes predefined converters for primitive types like booleans, integers, and floats, using standard OCaml parsing functions, and allows creating custom converters with `make` or duplicating existing ones with `like`. Use cases include parsing CLI arguments, validating configuration inputs, and mapping string-based data to typed values with precise error handling.",

It supports ordered traversal (ascending/descending), aggregation (cardinality, bindings), extremal key access, and sequence-based construction/iteration, enabling efficient ordered data manipulation. Typical use cases include managing method-value associations requiring ordered traversal, bulk sequence transformations, or conditional key-range operations while preserving structural integrity.",
