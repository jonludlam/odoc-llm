It provides functions for reading and writing files, computing standard deviation, executing shell commands, measuring execution time, and splitting data for machine learning tasks. Concrete use cases include processing log files, calculating metrics from numerical data, filtering text lines, and preparing training/test datasets.",

It works with dense, space-separated CSV files where the first column is the target variable and subsequent columns are features. Concrete use cases include optimizing PLS components for cross-validated regression performance, training a final model, and applying it to new data for prediction output to file or list.",

It provides data types such as lists, numerical arrays, and CSV data structures, along with operations for file I/O, standard deviation calculation, command execution, time measurement, data splitting, and PLS regression. You can use it to read and filter log files, compute metrics from numerical datasets, split data for training and testing, and build and evaluate PLS regression models from CSV input. Example workflows include processing raw data into training sets, optimizing PLS components for prediction accuracy, and generating model outputs for new datasets.",
