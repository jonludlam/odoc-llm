It works with strings, float lists, and generic lists for tasks like splitting, filtering, and processing lines from files. Concrete use cases include reading and writing float data from files, computing standard deviation, executing shell commands, performing train/test splits on datasets, and generating cross-validation folds.",

It works with CSV files containing numerical data in space-separated format, where the first column is the target variable and the remaining columns are features. The module supports cross-validation during optimization, model training with a specified number of components, and prediction either in-memory or directly to a file.",
