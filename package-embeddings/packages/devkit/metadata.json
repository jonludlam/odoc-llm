It supports operations like argument flipping, tuple mapping, currying, and lazy value forcing, along with utilities for string-to-integer conversion, reference manipulation, and formatted printing. Concrete use cases include simplifying function pipelines, handling optional values, and managing mutable state succinctly.",
