Operates on lists of Lwt promises and custom pipeline stages represented as functions. Used to build efficient data processing pipelines in networked applications, such as parallel API requests with aggregated results.",

Operates on input-output pairs, result types, and tuples containing keys. Used to build and execute pipelines that maintain input order while applying serial or parallel transformations, and to separate successful and error results from a stream.",
