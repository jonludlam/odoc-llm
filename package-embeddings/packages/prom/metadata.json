It enables reading JSON configuration files, serializing OCaml values, and integrating with web services via JSON payloads. A child module structures file-based service discovery configurations with targets and static labels, supporting dynamic target management and JSON serialization. Together, they allow building and processing structured JSON data for configuration and monitoring use cases.",

It provides specialized functions for list-valued maps, ordered merging, and safe value extraction via optional returns, while enabling bulk construction from and conversion to sequences. Designed for managing Prometheus time series labels, it ensures consistent key ordering for deterministic iteration and merging, with use cases including metric tagging, label set manipulation, and time series identification.",

It integrates efficient data structures such as KLL sketches for quantile computation, sorted sets for ordered numeric operations, and specialized maps for managing string and float-keyed data with ordered traversal and safe access. You can track application performance metrics with labeled distributions, aggregate sampled data efficiently, or compute approximate statistics over large streams using compact summaries. Submodules handle label set manipulation, numeric range analysis, and ordered dictionary transformations, supporting use cases from metric exposition to real-time analytics.",
