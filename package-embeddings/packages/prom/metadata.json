It emphasizes ordered traversal (via `iter`, `to_seq`, and `to_rev_seq`) and structural manipulation (union, intersection, partition) with key comparisons determining ordering. Use cases include maintaining sorted key-value associations, processing hierarchical data with string paths, and converting between maps and sequences while preserving key order.",

It supports transformations through mapping and filtering, ordered iteration, and bidirectional conversions to and from float sequences, leveraging total ordering for efficient comparisons. Designed for numerical applications requiring precise set-theoretic manipulations, it optimizes tasks like range queries, monotonic data analysis, and ordered stream processing.",

It provides transformations, filtering, and bulk modifications through iterators, folds, and sequence conversions, with use cases involving time-series data, interval tracking, or scenarios requiring precise ordered key management. The design emphasizes key ordering, enabling predicate-based traversal and structural manipulations like splitting or merging maps based on float key relationships.",

It offers operations for ordered insertion, deletion, merging, and traversal, along with transformations, filtering, and sequence-based construction, ensuring efficient lookups and ordered processing. It is particularly suited for systems requiring precise label management in time series databases or monitoring tools, where maintaining key order and enabling fast, side-effect-free updates are critical.",
