It provides functions to parse lines of input into structured rows and headers, handling both complete lines and lines without newlines. The module is used to transform raw text input into typed data structures for further processing.",

It operates on lexing buffers and files, with functions to tokenize file contents or extract rows for structured text processing. Key use cases include parsing headers and string literals into tokens for downstream parsing, as well as validating and transforming lexed data with robust error handling.",

It provides types for numerical and string values, along with row and header structures that distinguish between dense lists and sparse key-value pairs. These types are used to model tabular data with mixed types, supporting operations like row parsing, header alignment, and data serialization.",
