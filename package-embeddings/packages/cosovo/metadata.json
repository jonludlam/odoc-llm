It operates on Lexing.lexbuf buffers, strings, and file paths, enabling tasks like extracting integers, floating-point numbers, and constructing tokens from input sources. Use cases include processing configuration files, analyzing programming language syntax, and generating structured tokens from raw text inputs.",
