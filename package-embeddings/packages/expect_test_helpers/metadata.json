      "description": "This module extends test development capabilities with tools for s-expression manipulation, memory allocation verification, and asynchronous workflow validation. It introduces types like `t` for controlling output printing behavior in tests, with options such as `Always`, `If_unclean_exit`, and `Never`, and supports operations on containers, hashable types, deferred computations, and system processes. Users can generate source-stable output, enforce bounded memory usage checks, and execute subprocesses with assertions that handle failures gracefully. The integration of async-aware functions enables precise control over logging and test output based on execution outcomes.",
