It supports type manipulation tasks such as constructing and deconstructing function types, pretty-printing type expressions with custom formatting tags, and representing algebraic data types like records, sums, and aliases. Concrete use cases include generating human-readable type signatures and handling polymorphic and composite type expressions in a Boltzgen compiler or interpreter context.",
