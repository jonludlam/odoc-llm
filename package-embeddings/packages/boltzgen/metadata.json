It addresses concurrency concerns by highlighting risks of non-atomic operations like iteration and blitting, particularly with float arrays where data races may cause inconsistent results or \"tearing\" during memory accesses. Use cases include parallel data processing, array concatenation, and safe conversions between arrays and lists, though synchronization mechanisms like mutexes are required for thread-safe updates.",
