Works with data types such as public keys, credential IDs, and challenge tokens exchanged during user authentication. Used to implement secure, passwordless login flows in web applications by integrating with browser-based authentication mechanisms.",

      "description": "This module facilitates WebAuthn registration and authentication workflows using P256 keys, handling cryptographic challenges, JSON-encoded responses, and structured data for FIDO U2F and none attestation methods. It enables secure user verification by generating and validating cryptographic proofs, with operations requiring external storage of public keys, credential IDs, and challenges. Common use cases include initializing authentication contexts, registering device-specific public keys via server challenges, and authenticating users through platform or external security tokens.",
