It supports array creation (zeros, ones, gaussian), shape transformations (slicing, reshaping, transposing), element-wise arithmetic and mathematical functions, reductions (sum, min, max), and advanced numerical operations like convolution, FFT, and linear algebra primitives. Designed for machine learning, signal processing, and scientific computing, it enables efficient manipulation of multi-dimensional numerical data with both scalar and array-level interactions.",
