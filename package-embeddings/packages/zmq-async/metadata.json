It works with a specialized socket type that wraps ZeroMQ's monitoring capabilities, allowing observation of connection and disconnection events. Concrete use cases include tracking client connections in a server or detecting when a publisher socket loses subscribers.",

      "description": "This module enables asynchronous communication over ZeroMQ sockets, supporting both raw string and Zmq.Msg.t message transmission, with operations for sending and receiving multiple messages in a single call. It integrates direct socket I/O with deferred operations for non-blocking workflows, such as implementing request-response interactions, streaming data between services, and handling multi-part message exchanges. The monitoring submodule captures connection and disconnection events asynchronously, allowing real-time tracking of client activity or subscriber status. The routing submodule directs messages to specific endpoints using string-based IDs with router sockets, enabling targeted communication in request-response or publish-subscribe systems.",
