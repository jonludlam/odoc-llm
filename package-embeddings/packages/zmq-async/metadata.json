Works with router sockets, string identifiers, and lists of message frames. Use this module to implement request-response patterns where messages must be routed to specific clients based on their identity.",

It works with a specialized socket type that wraps ZeroMQ's monitoring capabilities, allowing observation of connection and disconnection events. Concrete use cases include tracking client connections, detecting socket failures, and managing dynamic network topologies in distributed systems.",

It works directly with ZeroMQ socket types, string data, and message frame lists, enabling precise control over network communication. Concrete use cases include implementing asynchronous network servers and clients that require non-blocking send and receive operations with explicit message framing.",

It directly handles ZeroMQ socket types and message structures, allowing fine-grained control over network protocols. It is ideal for building high-performance, event-driven network services and clients that require explicit message framing and low-latency communication.",
