It assumes paths are symbolic-link-free and focuses on abstract manipulation, such as validating path structures, resolving relative paths, and checking subdirectory relationships, making it ideal for scenarios requiring high-performance path analysis without filesystem interaction, like static path validation or hierarchical data processing.",

It works with abstract `filename` and `extension` types that decouple path manipulation from the real filesystem, optimizing performance for repeated operations under the assumption of no symbolic links. It is particularly useful for tasks like batch filename processing, path analysis, or canonicalization where symbolic links are pre-resolved or irrelevant.",

It supports path composition, normalization, and comparison, along with checks for validity, relative/absolute status, and extension handling, all acting on abstract `filename` and `extension` types decoded once for performance. Ideal for static analysis or batch processing of paths in Cygwin contexts where symbolic links are irrelevant or pre-resolved, avoiding redundant filesystem interactions.",

It works with abstract `filename` and `extension` types to encapsulate path components, supporting tasks like directory navigation, extension management, and path analysis while adhering to Unix conventions. Ideal for scenarios requiring efficient path processing in Unix environments where symbolic links are resolved externally via `FileUtil.readlink` and paths undergo multiple transformations or comparisons.",
