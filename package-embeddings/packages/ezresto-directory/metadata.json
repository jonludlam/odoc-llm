      "description": "This module organizes HTTP services into hierarchical directories that route requests based on method and path patterns, supporting dynamic subtree generation, directory merging, and conflict resolution. It provides core types like directory trees composed of path segments and service handlers, with operations for registering static and dynamic routes, attaching metadata, and introspecting directory structure. Merging directories allows combining multiple service trees while preserving routing logic, and dynamic registration enables on-demand subtree creation based on path parameters. Example uses include building RESTful APIs with nested resources and generating service documentation from directory contents.",
