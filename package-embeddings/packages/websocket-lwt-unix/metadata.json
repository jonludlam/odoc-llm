      "description": "This module provides low-level I/O operations for handling WebSocket message framing and transmission over established connections. It works with input and output channels (`ic` and `oc`) to read and write binary or line-based data, supporting asynchronous communication patterns required by the WebSocket protocol. Concrete use cases include reading framed messages from a client or server, writing binary payloads, and ensuring data is fully flushed to the underlying transport.",

It works with input and output channels (`ic` and `oc`) and supports monadic composition via `bind` (`>>=`) and value wrapping via `return`. Concrete use cases include implementing custom WebSocket message parsers, sending and receiving framed messages, and managing buffered I/O during connection handling.",

It works with `Websocket.Frame.t`, `Cohttp.Request.t`, and `Conduit.endp` to handle message framing, HTTP handshake details, and network endpoints. Concrete use cases include implementing real-time messaging clients, handling bidirectional WebSocket communication, and managing connection state during protocol upgrades.",

It works with input and output channels (`ic` and `oc`) to process WebSocket messages asynchronously, supporting both binary and text payloads. Concrete use cases include sending a WebSocket response with a body, reading incoming response chunks, and ensuring correct framing during client-server communication.",

It works with input and output channels (`ic` and `oc`) to manage WebSocket message framing, supporting operations like reading request chunks, writing body data, and serializing headers. Concrete use cases include implementing WebSocket handshake logic, streaming message payloads, and handling chunked transfer encoding during connection setup or data exchange.",
