It supports indexed and non-indexed traversals with control over parallel or sequential execution, working with types that represent deferred computations. Concrete use cases include processing asynchronous collections, aggregating results from multiple deferred computations, and performing conditional or indexed transformations on lazy deferred data.",

It supports time-based types and polymorphic collections with time zone-aware conversions, allowing pipelines that process nested or temporal data with short-circuiting and index-aware aggregation. The first child module extends these operations to deferred values with control over execution order, enabling asynchronous processing of lazy collections and aggregation of distributed results. The second child module integrates lenses with async functions for transforming and aggregating nested structures, supporting side effects, counting, and summation over deferred traversals.",
