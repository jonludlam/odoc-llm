It works with generic, indexable, and summable data types wrapped in `Lazy_deferred`. Use it to traverse and transform collections asynchronously, aggregating results or side effects without forcing evaluation immediately.",

It handles data types with multiple or nonempty substructures, enabling tasks like mapping, summing, counting, and reducing over deferred values. Concrete use cases include processing asynchronous collections, aggregating results from multiple deferred computations, and performing conditional operations on structured data with indices.",

      "description": "This module provides composable mechanisms for asynchronous data traversal and transformation, focusing on indexed and non-indexed collection manipulation. It operates on composite data structures through accessors that support operations like asynchronous folding, mapping, filtering, and aggregation (e.g., summing, counting, existence checks) while handling optional values and index-aware traversals. Designed for scenarios requiring structured data querying and incremental computation over asynchronous streams, it enables building complex accessors from primitive operations with support for non-empty collections, isomorphism-based transformations, and lazy evaluation patterns.",
