It works with a custom type `t` and processes input as arrays of integer tuples, enabling precise control over hardware signal routing and timing. Users can define event flows, manage port states, and synchronize data transmission in real-time applications. Examples include coordinating sensor data output or managing communication between embedded system components.",
