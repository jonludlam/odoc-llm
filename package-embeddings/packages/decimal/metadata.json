It works with contexts that encapsulate these settings and influence operations like rounding, overflow handling, and result formatting. Concrete use cases include configuring financial calculations to use specific rounding rules like `Half_even` or setting precision bounds for currency conversions.",

It provides operations to create, query, and modify signal states, along with identifiers for specific signal types such as division by zero, overflow, and rounding. These signals are used to track and respond to events like invalid operations or loss of precision during calculations involving decimal numbers.",
