Operates on custom `id` types and `array` structures representing sets of signals. Used to track and respond to specific decimal arithmetic conditions like division by zero, overflow, and inexact results during numerical computations.",

Operates on types representing rounding modes, context configurations, and signal arrays to control computational behavior. Used to configure arithmetic operations for consistent results in financial calculations, scientific simulations, and error-sensitive applications.",

It works with a custom decimal type that represents numbers with user-defined precision and scale. Used for financial calculations, scientific computations, and any scenario requiring exact decimal arithmetic.",

Supports creation and manipulation of contexts with defined precision and rounding modes, and tracks computational conditions through signal arrays. Allows operations like division, modulus, and comparisons with exact results, such as computing 1.00 mod 0.1 to yield 0.00. Provides tools to inspect and modify signal states, ensuring accurate handling of edge cases in numerical computations.",
