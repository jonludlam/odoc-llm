It provides operations to create a client session with a specified protocol, upgrade the connection, check its closed status, and shut it down asynchronously. Concrete use cases include implementing clients for protocols like HTTP/2 or WebSockets over a MirageOS flow.",

It provides functions to create connection handlers that process incoming requests on a given socket, supporting both upgradable protocols and fixed protocol instances. The module works directly with socket flows and request handlers, making it suitable for implementing custom network services like HTTP servers or RPC endpoints.",

It works with MirageOS flow types, enabling buffering of input and output operations to improve performance in network or I/O-bound applications. Concrete use cases include handling HTTP requests, streaming data over sockets, and implementing custom network protocols with buffered I/O.",
