Maintains a single-value buffer with read/write access, enabling state management in event-driven systems, and supports network I/O with error handling, flow control, and proper resource cleanup. Operations include reading and writing data using `Cstruct.t` buffers, handling write-specific errors, and managing asynchronous transmission. Examples include tracking input state in a parser, sending data over a network, and recovering from I/O failures.",
