It works with MirageOS flow types, enabling asynchronous reading and writing while handling partial reads and writes. Concrete use cases include implementing network protocols, managing I/O streams in unikernels, and handling chunked data transfer over connections.",

It works with `socket` values representing buffered flows over a `Flow` module's connections, and it supports protocols built with `Gluten.runtime`. Use this to implement custom network servers that handle requests with typed protocols, such as building an HTTP or RPC server on top of a MirageOS-compatible network stack.",

It provides operations to create a client instance with a specified buffer size and protocol, upgrade the connection to a different implementation, and shut down the connection asynchronously. Concrete use cases include implementing clients for protocols like HTTP/2 or WebSockets over a MirageOS flow.",

It includes server-side handling of incoming connections with protocol-driven request processing, client-side management of protocol upgrades, and lifecycle control for asynchronous connections. Key data types include buffered flows, socket wrappers, and protocol handlers, with operations for reading, writing, upgrading, and shutting down connections. You can use it to build custom network servers with typed protocols, implement HTTP/2 or WebSockets clients, and manage chunked or streaming data over MirageOS-compatible network stacks.",
