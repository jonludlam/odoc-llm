It provides functions for ISO8601-based formatting, parsing, and precise decomposition of periods into exact days or year-month-day units, working with `date` values for temporal points and `period` values for durations. These capabilities are essential for applications like scheduling systems, financial calculations requiring precise day counts, or generating human-readable time differences.",
