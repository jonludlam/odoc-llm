It works with `date` and `period` types, along with rounding options that may trigger ambiguous computations during date adjustments. Use cases include financial calculations, scheduling, and calendar management, where precise date manipulations and handling of edge cases like leap years are critical.",

Works with YYYY-MM-DD date strings and period structures defined in days, months, or years.

Adjusts dates by adding or subtracting periods, validates leap years, and handles rounding that may introduce ambiguity. It enables precise financial computations, such as interest accruals, and manages calendar events with accurate date transitions. Examples include determining the next business day or calculating the number of days between two dates.",
