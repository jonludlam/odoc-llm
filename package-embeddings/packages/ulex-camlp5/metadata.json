Operates on strings, integer arrays, and character streams. Used to decode UTF-8 data from files, process incoming network data, and generate encoded output for storage or transmission.",

      "description": "The module offers low-level lexical analysis operations, including buffer creation, position tracking, and character extraction for streams, arrays, and channels with support for Latin-1, UTF-8, and variable encodings. It enables manipulation of input buffers with features like backtracking and encoded lexeme retrieval, working directly with `lexbuf` structures to manage text processing tasks. This is particularly useful for parsing applications requiring precise control over input handling and encoding-specific operations.",
