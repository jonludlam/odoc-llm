It processes type declarations to produce AST fragments representing diff logic, supporting use cases like code analysis and data synchronization. Submodules handle identifier generation for standard values and accessors, construct record field manipulators, and derive naming conventions for constructors and accessors. For example, it can automatically generate a diff function for a record type that compares each field and returns a structured difference.",

It enables composing field operations using infix operators to traverse nested records, retrieve or update values, and handle missing or optional intermediate fields. Key data types include field combinators and optional-aware transformations, allowing operations like safely accessing a nested record field or setting a value through a chain of optional fields. For example, you can compose accessors to retrieve a value from a deeply nested structure or update a field while propagating errors if any intermediate field is missing.",

It combines field-based accessors with difference operations to track and modify nested, optional, and structured values. You can define difference specs using leaf, child, and optional child nodes, then compute deltas between values or apply patches through composed field accessors. For example, you can build a spec to detect changes in a nested configuration object, then apply those changes incrementally to update a document model.",
