      "description": "This module defines infix operators for composing and transforming field accessors that work with optional and nested values. It provides operators `--|` for chaining field accesses, `?+` for mapping optional fields, and `?*` for binding through optional fields, enabling concise traversal and manipulation of deeply nested data structures. These operations are particularly useful when working with records or trees where fields may be optional or require lifting into option types.",

It provides operations for safely getting, setting, and transforming values within structured data like records and trees, with explicit error handling for missing or invalid fields. Use cases include traversing and modifying deeply nested records, handling optional fields without boilerplate, and building reusable data transformation pipelines.",

It works with arbitrary user-defined types through a specification tree that describes how to traverse and compare nested and optional fields. Concrete use cases include generating precise deltas between two versions of a complex record or tree structure, and applying those deltas to update one version to another.",
