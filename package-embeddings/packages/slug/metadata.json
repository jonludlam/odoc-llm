      "description": "This library transforms strings into URL-safe slugs by normalizing UTF-8 input, replacing non-alphanumeric characters using customizable mappings, and substituting whitespace with a specified separator. It supports operations like lowercasing, custom separator selection, and language-specific character replacement through predefined mappings such as `base`, `de`, and `es`. Child modules provide structured charmaps and replacement logic, enabling users to generate localized slugs or define custom substitution rules for specific use cases like web routing or content indexing. Direct API functions allow easy integration with standard OCaml strings while maintaining flexibility for advanced normalization strategies.",
