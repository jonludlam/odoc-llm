It works with `Bechamel.Measure.witness` values that represent specific performance metrics available through hardware and kernel support. Concrete use cases include profiling application performance, measuring code efficiency, and diagnosing system-level bottlenecks on Linux systems with kernel 2.6+.",

It works directly with `Mperf.t` values to capture low-level system metrics during benchmarking. Use it to measure and analyze specific hardware and software performance events in Linux environments where root access is available or properly configured.",
