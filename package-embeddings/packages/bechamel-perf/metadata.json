It works with `Mperf.t` values to measure and report low-level system performance events during program execution. Use it to profile application performance on Linux systems where `perf` is available, such as measuring cache efficiency or CPU utilization in performance-critical code.",

It works directly with `Bechamel.Measure.witness` to capture and report hardware and software event metrics during benchmarking. Use it to measure and compare the performance of OCaml code sections with high precision on Linux systems.",
