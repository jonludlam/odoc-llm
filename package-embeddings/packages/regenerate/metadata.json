Formats lists for pretty printing using a custom formatter. Operates on lists of any element type, supporting structured comparisons and readable output. Used to sort lists, determine equality, or generate human-readable representations in logging or debugging.",

      "description": "Provides functions for decoding integers from strings in various endianness formats, including 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit values. Supports both signed and unsigned interpretations and includes utilities for substring operations. Main data types include int, int32, and int64, with operations like decoding and concatenation. Examples include extracting a 32-bit integer from a string's byte sequence or finding a substring within a larger string.",

The module operates on the `t` type, which represents sequences of characters, and the `char` type. It is used to efficiently combine and process character streams, such as building strings from lists or iterating over character data for output.",
