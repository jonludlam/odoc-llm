It supports bidirectional conversion between maps and sequences of key-value pairs, enabling efficient processing of structured data like configuration hierarchies or parsed symbolic representations. The design emphasizes functional purity and composability, with utilities for handling optional values, lists, and comparison-based queries.",

It provides operations to classify characters based on standardized Unicode properties, such as identifying lowercase letters (`ll`) or decimal digits (`nd`), and groups these sets into broader categories like separators or symbols. These definitions are particularly useful for implementing lexers that require robust handling of internationalized identifiers, numeric literals, or structured text formats.",
