It works with RGB image data represented as 8-bit integer arrays and window objects that can be updated, resized, or destroyed. Concrete use cases include interactive image processing tools, real-time visualization of image data, and GUI-based image analysis applications.",

It operates on 8-bit grayscale or RGB images stored as `Bimage.Image.t` and supports dynamic window updates, user input, and custom drawing operations. You can use it to build GUI applications for real-time image processing, annotate images with vector graphics, or visualize image data with interactive controls. Example applications include image viewers with zoom and pan, annotation tools, and interactive analysis interfaces.",
