It provides `upcast` to convert `t` to `super` and `downcast` to convert `super` back to `t`, enforcing type safety during the process. It is useful for refining types based on singleton values, such as modeling unique identifiers or constrained values with runtime validation.",

It supports safe upcasting from the refined type to the base type and downcasting from the base type back to the refined type. This is useful for modeling type hierarchies where certain values of a common type require additional constraints or semantic distinctions.",

It provides mechanisms for defining refined types with enforced invariants, supporting safe upcasting and downcasting between base and refined types, and modeling constrained values such as positive integers or validated data structures. Submodules implement specific refinement strategies, including singleton-based constraints, predicate-based validation, and abstract invariants, allowing precise control over value membership and type relationships. Examples include narrowing integers to positive values, restricting strings to valid identifiers, and ensuring lists are non-empty through type refinement.",
