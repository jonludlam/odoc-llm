It uses a key type with a hash function and equality predicate, enforces non-sentinel keys for user operations, and supports value storage with customizable memory management. Commonly applied in scenarios requiring efficient key-value lookups, cache implementations, or hash table debugging with detailed performance metrics.",

It operates on elements of type `H.t`, leveraging array-like structures from `K` for storage and `S`'s `void`/`tomb` sentinels to track occupancy, supporting efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup. It is suited for scenarios requiring fine-grained control over hash table behavior, such as handling collision resolution strategies, dynamic resizing, or analyzing distribution statistics.",

It manages a dynamically resizable array storing elements alongside special void and tombstone markers to track occupancy, offering in-place modifications and copy-based transformations while ensuring sentinels remain distinct from stored values. Typical use cases include optimizing memory-constrained collections with frequent updates, analyzing hash table performance through capacity statistics, and handling domain-specific data types requiring non-default equality semantics.",
