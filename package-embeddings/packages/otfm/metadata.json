It supports operations between string, integer, and binary representations of these tags, enabling access to critical font data such as glyph outlines (`glyf`), character mappings (`cmap`), kerning pairs (`kern`), and digital signatures (`dsig`) during font decoding or processing. These operations are essential for low-level manipulation and analysis of font structures.",

It operates on in-memory font data using decoders and result types to handle parsing errors, supporting use cases like text rendering engines or font analysis tools that require direct access to OpenType table structures. Key data structures include encoded tags, Unicode ranges, and validated font metadata extracted from raw OpenType streams.",
