      "description": "This module manages stateful RPC interactions with a server, allowing clients to dispatch queries, receive responses, and maintain persistent query state across multiple requests. It supports polling semantics by enabling query reuse via `redispatch`, and provides explicit control over server-side state via `forget_on_server`. The module works with RPC connections and buses to deliver responses paired with their corresponding queries, making it suitable for long-lived clients that need to track and react to repeated or ongoing requests.",

It includes functions like `diffs` to generate an `Update.t` delta between two values and `update` to apply such a delta, enabling efficient state synchronization. The `Update` submodule encapsulates the logic for representing and manipulating these state changes, specifically tailored for use in polling-based RPC systems where incremental updates are transmitted over the wire.",

It works directly with the `Update.t` type, providing support for efficient binary encoding and decoding, including handling polymorphic variant constructor tags. Concrete use cases include transmitting and persisting polling state changes in distributed systems or logging state transitions for debugging and replay.",

      "description": "This module provides a `create_client` function to build a client for a polling state RPC, working with generic query and response types to customize initial queries and inspect state transitions. Its `Response` submodule includes a utility to convert response values into S-expressions using a provided conversion function, enabling readable serialization of test responses for debugging. Together, they support testing polling logic by simulating state changes and logging structured responses. For example, you can construct a test client that logs each response as an S-expression to trace how queries evolve during polling.",

It supports versioned state synchronization using types like `t` for state representation, `Update.t` for capturing deltas, and functions such as `diffs` and `update` for efficient state transmission. Clients can dispatch queries, redispatch them for continued tracking, and control server-side state lifecycle with operations like `forget_on_server`. It integrates with buses for streaming and supports binary and S-expression serialization, making it suitable for real-time job tracking or distributed state monitoring with structured logging and testable client behavior.",
