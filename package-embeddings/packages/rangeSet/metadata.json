      "description": "This module provides operations to manage collections of non-overlapping discrete ranges over a totally ordered type, supporting set-theoretic operations (union, intersection, difference), range inclusion checks, and element membership tests. It works with two core structures: `range` (defined by `start` and `stop` bounds) and `t` (an ordered collection of ranges), leveraging the module's total ordering to enable efficient traversal, transformation via element-wise mapping, and ordered enumeration. It is particularly useful for domains like interval arithmetic, genomic coordinate manipulation, or resource scheduling where precise handling of discrete intervals and their relationships is required.",

      "description": "This module enables the construction and manipulation of continuous range sets defined over a totally ordered type, supporting operations like union, difference, intersection, and coverage checks on ranges with inclusive or exclusive endpoints. It uses a custom `t` type to represent collections of ranges, where each range is bounded by ordered `point` values, and provides utilities for merging overlapping intervals, testing membership, and converting sets to string representations. Typical applications include interval arithmetic, time window aggregation, or resource allocation systems where contiguous spans of ordered values require efficient set-theoretic operations.",
