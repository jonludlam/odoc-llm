It works with abstract logging handles and predefined severity levels and facilities, such as `LOG_ERR` or `LOG_DAEMON`. Concrete use cases include logging application events to the system log, reporting errors with appropriate severity, and ensuring proper log handling during daemon startup and shutdown.",
