It works with strings and encoding identifiers, using a converter structure to manage input and output encodings.

It transforms gettext structures into optimized forms, resolves deferred values, and enables fast key-based lookup of localized strings. Charset conversion is integrated to handle text transcoding between encodings like UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 during data loading. Example usage includes initializing a translation map for a specific locale, converting message keys to localized strings, and processing translation files across different character encodings.",
