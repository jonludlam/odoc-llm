It operates specifically on the translation data types defined in `GettextTypes`, which represent message catalogs and their entries. A concrete use case is finalizing a parsed `.mo` file's contents into an optimized, ready-to-use translation map at runtime.",

It operates on gettext translation structures, enabling concrete translation lookups by resolving references to message catalogs. This is essential when implementing multilingual applications that require dynamic loading of translations based on locale settings.",

It works with strings and encoding names, providing a `create` function to set up a converter from an input to an output encoding, and `recode` to apply that conversion to a string. It is used when translating text between character sets, such as converting UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1 during message localization.",
