It works with data structures such as message representations, option lists, and enumerations for codes and content formats, enabling tasks like parsing network traffic or managing IoT communications. Specific use cases include processing CoAP protocol data in client-server interactions and manipulating message payloads and headers.",

Operates on `Message.t` for request and response data, and uses Lwt for asynchronous event handling. Used to implement networked services that respond to CoAP-based client interactions.",

It supports generating responses with specific codes, processing incoming requests asynchronously, and serializing messages for transmission. Functions include creating 'not found' or content responses, binding to network endpoints, and decoding message structures. Examples include building IoT communication protocols, handling client-server exchanges, and parsing network traffic.",
