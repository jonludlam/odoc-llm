It supports buffer-based encoding and decoding for network communication, along with utilities to inspect message properties like confirmability or extract structured data (e.g., tokens, codes). Applications include handling CoAP packets in network stacks, processing message metadata, and debugging via human-readable representations of messages.",

It works with CoAP message buffers and message types, allowing customization of headers, tokens, and response codes. Concrete use cases include generating \"Not Found\" error responses or \"Content\" success responses in CoAP servers handling client requests.",

It handles incoming client requests using a provided handler function that processes CoAP messages and returns responses asynchronously.

It defines core data types like `t` for CoAP messages and provides operations for encoding, decoding, and inspecting messages, including managing headers, options, and payloads. The server submodule starts an asynchronous listener that processes incoming requests, while the response submodule constructs tailored CoAP responses with custom codes and payloads. Example uses include parsing CoAP packets from a network buffer, building a CoAP server that returns JSON content, or generating error responses for invalid requests.",
