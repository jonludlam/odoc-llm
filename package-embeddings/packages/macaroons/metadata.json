Concrete use cases include constructing delegated authorization tokens with fine-grained contextual constraints and securely verifying access control policies in distributed systems.",

It centers around the `t` type for macaroons, with operations to add caveats, bind discharge tokens, and validate against keys and conditions. You can construct macaroons with fine-grained access constraints, delegate authority securely across services, and verify tokens using either built-in or optimized cryptographic backends. Use it to implement decentralized, revocable access control for APIs and distributed systems without a central authority.",
