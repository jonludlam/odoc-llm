Works with audio ports, client contexts, and sample data represented as arrays. Used to create real-time audio applications that route signals between software components in a low-latency environment.",

It interacts with JACK client state objects to retrieve metrics such as sample rates, channel counts, and buffer statistics, facilitating real-time audio configuration and monitoring. Use cases include precise audio latency tuning, dynamic volume control, and diagnostic analysis of audio client performance.",
