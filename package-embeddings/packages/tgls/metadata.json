It works with OpenGL object identifiers, enumerated constants, bitfields, and typed memory buffers to enable tasks like shader compilation, texture compression, transform feedback, and multi-target rendering. Specific use cases include implementing custom rendering pipelines, optimizing GPU memory usage through buffer mapping, and configuring advanced graphics features like multisampling or compute shaders.",
