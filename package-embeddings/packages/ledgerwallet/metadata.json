It provides core data types such as `Hidapi.t` for device handles, `Cstruct.t` buffers for binary data, and structured APDU and status types for command and response handling. Operations include sending and receiving APDU commands, error handling via status codes, and device pinging, allowing tasks like signing cryptocurrency transactions or retrieving wallet data. Specific use cases include building wallet interfaces, command-line tools for blockchain interactions, and secure cryptographic operations with hardware-backed keys.",
