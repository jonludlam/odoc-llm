It works directly with the `t` type, which represents a view into a buffer's memory, tracking the current position, length, and continuation behavior. Concrete use cases include parsing binary data formats and implementing custom serialization logic by directly accessing memory without copying.",

It provides operations to inspect and modify buffer contents, including indexing, dropping bytes, and formatted writing, with a focus on binary data handling. Concrete use cases include building network protocol parsers, serializing structured data, and managing streaming I/O buffers without unnecessary copying.",
