It works directly with the `t` type, which represents a view into a buffer's memory with position, length, and continuation metadata. Concrete use cases include parsing binary data formats, implementing custom serialization logic, and efficiently processing network packets.",

      "description": "This module provides extensible buffers for efficient binary data handling using bigstrings, supporting dynamic appending of data and direct memory manipulation through views. It includes core operations for buffer management\u2014such as appending, clearing, and resetting\u2014as well as a view system for inspecting and modifying specific regions of the buffer's memory. The view submodule enables low-level access to the buffer's underlying bigstring, allowing precise byte-level operations like reading and writing at offsets, advancing the current position, and ensuring bounds safety. Use cases include constructing and parsing binary protocols, managing streaming I/O, and implementing custom serialization formats.",
