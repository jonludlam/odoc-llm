It includes maps and sets for structured data manipulation, arithmetic operations for precise mathematical calculations, and utilities for tracking explanations in a simplex-based system. You can use it to implement solvers that handle linear programming tasks, manage collections of unique elements, perform exact arithmetic with rationals, and track reasoning behind constraint assignments. Submodules offer concrete implementations for dictionaries, sets, and arithmetic types, enabling efficient key-value management, set transformations, and numeric operations with customizable precision.",

It supports operations to extract values, apply fallbacks, and sequence computations that may fail, such as parsing or I/O. Submodules extend this foundation with domain-specific data and operations: they manage variables and bounds in linear programming, define arithmetic and comparison logic for numeric and rational types, track constraints and explanations, and provide data structures like sets and maps for variable collections. Examples include extracting simplex optimization results, performing arithmetic on perturbed rationals, combining constraint explanations, and managing variable assignments during constraint solving.",

Its submodules implement arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), comparisons, and checks (zero, integer, sign) on bound pairs, enabling manipulation in linear programming and interval arithmetic. Concrete use cases include modeling constraints like `x < 3` as `3 - \u0190`, solving inequalities with exact rational arithmetic, and tracking bound adjustments through operations. The combined interface allows both direct bound manipulation and advanced arithmetic while preserving epsilon-based distinctions.",
