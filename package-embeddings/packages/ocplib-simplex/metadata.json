It supports arithmetic, comparison, interval intersections, and constraint solving, using types like `t`, `r`, and `Var.t` to represent variables, rationals, and intervals. Users can solve linear systems, track variable dependencies, and manage build rule sets through union and membership operations. Examples include enforcing integer constraints, generating dependency graphs, and performing exact fractional calculations.",
