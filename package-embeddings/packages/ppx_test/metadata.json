It enables constructing or modifying sets via sequence operations like `add_seq` and `of_seq`, facilitating tasks such as set algebra, data filtering, and sequence-to-set conversions. Key use cases include processing structured data elements, optimizing set manipulations, and integrating sequence-based workflows into set operations.",
