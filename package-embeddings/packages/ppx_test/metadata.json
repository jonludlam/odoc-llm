It structures tests with identifiers, execution logic, and failure expectations, while submodules handle reporting, outcome tracking, error representation, naming, and exception checking. The core API allows defining, collecting, and running tests, with concrete actions like checking if a function raises an exception or generating structured reports to stderr. Error results are represented as polymorphic variants and formatted for display, while test outcomes include timing data and success or failure status.",
