It works with audio device handles (`t`) and driver information (`driver_t`), supporting operations like querying driver properties, finding drivers by name, and configuring audio parameters such as bit depth, sample rate, and byte format. Concrete use cases include playing raw audio data through a selected driver, writing audio to a file, and listing or selecting available audio output drivers.",
