Supports Ctypes-based type mappings, function pointers, and memory operations to enable seamless C library integration. Allows precise control over calling conventions and type conversions during foreign function invocations. Enables developers to define and compose complex function signatures, such as binding a C function that takes a pointer and returns a struct.",
