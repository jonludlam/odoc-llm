It provides custom types for alarms, exit codes, state configurations, and logical expressions, along with operations to create, inspect, update, and enforce constraints. Users can manage timed events, track program flow, validate headers, and generate structured reports, such as setting a time limit, checking license compliance, or constructing logical formulas. It enables dynamic configuration, error handling, and precise control over parsing, type-checking, and execution workflows.",
