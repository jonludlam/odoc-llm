It enables efficient traversal, filtering, and aggregation over key-value pairs where keys represent GitLab branch/tag references and values can be arbitrary data types. Typical use cases include tracking pipeline states across GitLab branches, merging CI configuration metadata, or processing commit history in ordered sequences.",

Submodules enhance this functionality with specialized types for merge requests and references, public head commit retrieval, ordered reference maps, commit status reporting, and detailed commit and repository objects.
