It provides bulk transformations (e.g., merging, splitting, sequence-based updates) and maintains strict key ordering for deterministic iteration and functional updates. Such maps are particularly useful for tracking GitLab references (e.g., branches, tags) in workflows requiring ordered processing, such as commit history analysis or webhook event routing.",
