Works with custom and built-in types like integers, floats, and strings, using destruct and construct functions for bidirectional conversion. Used to define command-line argument handlers that validate and parse input according to specified formats.",

It includes types for arguments, paths, and queries, along with functions to parse, construct, and validate these components. For example, you can define a path like /user/123, parse a user ID from a string, and extract query parameters such as ?page=2. These elements collectively enable the creation of structured, type-safe API definitions that can be used for both server and client implementations.",
