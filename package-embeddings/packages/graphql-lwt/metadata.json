It provides functions like `map` to apply transformations, `iter` to perform side effects, and `close` to terminate streams. Concrete use cases include implementing subscriptions, batching results from event sources, or processing incremental updates from a GraphQL query.",

It supports efficient querying via predicates, key-based splitting, and value mapping, with utilities for ordered traversal and sequence conversion. Designed for scenarios requiring fast string-key access patterns, it's particularly suited to managing dynamic schema components like type definitions or field mappings in GraphQL services.",
