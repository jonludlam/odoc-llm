Applies a side-effecting function to each element, ensuring execution in sequence. Manages stream termination, allowing controlled closure of data sources. Works with Lwt-based stream structures, enabling asynchronous data processing. Used to chain asynchronous data transformations and manage resource cleanup in I/O operations.",

Supports controlled stream termination and resource cleanup, leveraging Lwt for non-blocking I/O. It enables chaining of asynchronous operations, such as filtering, mapping, or logging data as it flows. For example, it can read lines from a file, transform each line, and write the results to another file.",

It works with a polymorphic map type where keys are strings and values can be arbitrary, supporting sequence-based construction and safe or unsafe lookups. Use cases include configuration management, data aggregation, and scenarios requiring ordered key processing or map combination.",

It handles data transformation, state management, and input validation through operations like stream mapping, map merging, and argument parsing. Users can process file contents asynchronously, manage configuration data with ordered access, and enforce strict input rules for GraphQL queries. Examples include transforming log entries in real time, aggregating settings from multiple sources, and validating user input before executing a GraphQL operation.",
