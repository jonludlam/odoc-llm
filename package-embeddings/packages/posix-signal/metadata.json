It works with signal sets (`sigset`) and enumerated system signals like `Sigint` or `Sigterm`. Concrete use cases include blocking specific signals during critical sections, checking if a signal is in a set, or setting the signal mask for a process or thread.",

It includes data types representing signal numbers and operations to send, catch, and manage signals. For example, you can use it to handle `SIGINT` for graceful process termination or `SIGCHLD` to monitor child process status changes. Specific functionality includes signal masking, handler installation, and synchronous signal waiting.",

It includes the `sigset_t` type for representing and manipulating signal sets, allowing operations like adding or removing specific signals from a mask. These facilities support tasks such as configuring interrupt handling in concurrent programs or managing signal dispositions in low-level applications like servers or utilities. Direct use cases include blocking signals during critical sections or setting up custom signal handlers.",

It supports operations such as adding signals to a set, checking signal membership, and blocking or unblocking signals for the current thread or process. The `sigset_t` type represents the underlying signal set data structure, facilitating low-level control over signal masks in concurrent and system-level programs. Example uses include custom signal handling logic, selective signal blocking in multi-threaded applications, and integration with OS-level signal management APIs.",
