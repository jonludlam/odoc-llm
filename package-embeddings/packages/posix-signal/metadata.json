It provides the necessary type definitions to manipulate signal masks in system programming tasks, such as blocking or unblocking specific signals. Concrete use cases include configuring signal handling behavior in low-level applications like servers or system utilities.",

      "description": "This module defines integer constants for POSIX signal identifiers and manipulation flags, alongside a C-compatible `sigset_t` type for managing signal sets. It enables low-level signal handling configurations, such as blocking specific signals (e.g., `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`) or adjusting process signal masks in system programming contexts. The types and constants directly map to C's `<signal.h>` definitions, facilitating interoperability in scenarios like handling asynchronous interrupts or resource limits.",

It supports operations to block, unblock, or replace signal masks, working with signal sets and alignment constraints required for low-level system interactions. These values are essential for implementing custom signal handlers, managing process termination responses, or coordinating concurrency in event-driven applications.",
