      "description": "This module provides low-level primitives for symbolic execution, enabling precise manipulation of program state through operations on variables, memory addresses, and control flow constructs. It works directly with values, variables, and addresses to handle arithmetic, logical, and memory access tasks, while supporting structured control flow via branching and looping mechanisms within a monadic evaluation context. These capabilities are specifically applied to tasks like program analysis, state exploration, and emulating execution paths in binary code.",

      "description": "This module orchestrates the exploration of program states in a symbolic execution engine, managing state transitions, rescheduling, and visited term tracking using the core state type `Primus_exploring_main.t`. It integrates low-level symbolic execution primitives that manipulate variables, memory, and control flow, enabling precise program analysis and path emulation. With this module, users can prioritize execution paths, limit exploration depth, or track visited states during symbolic analysis. Direct operations include state enqueuing and rescheduling, while submodules handle fine-grained tasks like arithmetic, memory access, and branching within a monadic context.",

      "description": "This module provides utilities for parsing, converting, and documenting command-line configuration parameters, supporting operations like value extraction, type coercion, and readiness checks. It works with primitive types (bool, int, float), file system paths, collections (lists, arrays), tuples, and enums, using converters, readers, and futures to manage structured configuration data. Specific use cases include handling deprecated CLI flags, generating manpage documentation, and parsing complex values like comma-separated lists or key-value enums with custom separators.",

      "description": "This module drives a stateful exploration engine for binary analysis, coordinating a queue of machine states and tracking transitions by TID. It exposes logging, progress reporting with task metadata, and a scheduler interface to control exploration strategies, while its child modules handle symbolic execution primitives and configuration management. Users can enqueue and reschedule states, manipulate variables and memory in a monadic context, and define complex command-line parameters with type coercion and documentation generation. Specific capabilities include path prioritization, depth-limited exploration, and structured configuration parsing with support for lists, enums, and file paths.",
