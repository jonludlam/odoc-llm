It operates on symbolic values, addresses, and variables to model instruction semantics and virtual machine behavior, enabling tasks like program analysis, emulation, and constraint solving.",

It works with basic types (booleans, integers, floats), strings, enums, file paths, and composite structures (lists, arrays, tuples), using customizable separators and formatting rules. Typical applications include validating user-provided configuration values, generating documentation for parameter interfaces, and handling optional or multi-valued command-line arguments with deprecation warnings.",

It provides functions to enqueue processes for exploration, reschedule based on exploration depth, track visited terms, and initialize or advance execution states. It operates on machine states, process IDs, and program terms, specifically supporting tasks like path exploration, constraint solving, and program analysis.",

It maintains exploration state as a map of term IDs and a queue of pending processes, providing functions to report progress, manage logging levels, and register execution parameters. Key operations include state updates during exploration, progress reporting with task metadata, and configuration of exploration behavior through boolean flags and command-line parameters.",
