It directly manipulates the underlying `'a array` and `'a elt` types to enable constant-time size modifications and controlled-time insertions and deletions.

Built on a circular buffer using an array backend, it supports array-like access, bulk transformations, and safe iteration with protection against concurrent modifications. It is suited for sequences requiring frequent resizing at both ends\u2014such as queues or stacks\u2014and scenarios needing sorting, mapping, or converting between arrays and lists.",

It works with variable-sized arrays backed by a circular buffer representation, enabling efficient amortized resizing and in-place updates while maintaining O(1) or O(k) time complexity for access and modifications. These capabilities make it suitable for applications requiring frequent dynamic adjustments, such as implementing queues, deques, or sliding windows with high-performance traversal and transformation.",
