It works with `'a array` and `'a elt` types, organizing elements in a contiguous block with wraparound semantics to minimize reallocations. Concrete use cases include implementing queues with fast ends operations and managing sliding windows over streams of data.",

It provides direct operations on `'a elt` and `'a t` for mapping, folding, sorting, and linear-time arbitrary insertions or deletions, enabling use cases like dynamic collections and sliding windows. The child module handles low-level buffer management using arrays with index wrapping, exposing constant-time end modifications and direct array access for performance-critical applications.

The interface supports mapping, folding, sorting, and conversion to arrays or lists, making it suitable for dynamic buffers or mutation-heavy algorithms. Direct use of the child module allows fine-grained control over resizing and in-place updates, while the parent module abstracts these mechanisms into a sequence-friendly API.",
