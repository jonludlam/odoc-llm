      "description": "This module offers arithmetic and number-theoretic operations on finite field elements, including addition, multiplication, inversion, division, exponentiation, and quadratic residue checks, alongside conversions between byte, string, and integer representations. It supports cryptographic applications and algebraic computations by providing tools to manipulate field elements, verify properties like order and size, and compute roots or symbols essential for modular arithmetic. Specific use cases include implementing elliptic curve operations or solving equations over finite fields.",
