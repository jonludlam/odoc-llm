It offers arithmetic operations, evaluation via Horner's method or FFT, interpolation using Lagrange or FFT-based techniques, decomposition into even/odd components, and efficient multiplication algorithms. These capabilities are particularly useful in cryptographic protocols, error-correcting codes, and numerical algorithms requiring high-performance polynomial computations.",
