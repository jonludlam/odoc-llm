It provides structural operations for degree analysis, coefficient extraction, and Horner's method evaluation, requiring scalars to support ring operations or FFT-friendly properties like roots of unity. Applications include symbolic computation, numerical evaluation, and algebraic problem-solving via polynomial factorization or root-finding.",

It works with polynomials represented as type `t` and coefficients from a prime field `scalar`, offering algorithms like FFT-based interpolation, Lagrange evaluation, GCD computation, and decomposition into even/odd components. These tools are suited for algebraic computations requiring efficient polynomial operations, such as cryptographic protocols or error-correcting codes leveraging finite field arithmetic.",

      "description": "This module implements univariate polynomials over finite fields, with core operations including arithmetic, evaluation, interpolation, and degree analysis using FFT-based algorithms and Horner's method. It represents polynomials via coefficient arrays and supports scalar coefficients from prime fields or rings with roots of unity, enabling efficient multiplication, GCD computation, and decomposition into even/odd components. The module facilitates cryptographic protocols and algebraic computations through direct operations on polynomial structures and submodules that emphasize FFT-friendly arithmetic, Lagrange evaluation, and symbolic manipulation. Examples include evaluating polynomials at arbitrary points, interpolating from evaluation points using FFT, and performing Euclidean division for polynomial factorization or root-finding.",
