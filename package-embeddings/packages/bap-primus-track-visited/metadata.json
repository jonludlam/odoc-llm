It supports membership checks, addition, and removal of specific term IDs (TIDs) from the visited set, along with retrieving the full set of visited blocks. Direct use cases include querying whether a specific block has been executed, manually marking blocks as visited or unvisited, and obtaining a snapshot of all visited blocks at any point in the analysis.",
