It provides term conversion, comparison, and lookup operations for RDF terms, along with subject and object enumeration. Core functionality includes translating RDF terms to and from an internal representation and executing SPARQL-like triple pattern queries against a PostgreSQL-backed RDF graph.",

It supports graph handles and triple data structures for persistent RDF storage with transactional guarantees, enabling applications like semantic web systems and data integration platforms. The included query engine translates RDF terms and executes SPARQL-like triple pattern queries, offering term conversion, comparison, and enumeration capabilities. Advanced features such as graph state duplication, blank node ID generation, and metadata access enhance complex data synchronization and querying workflows.",
