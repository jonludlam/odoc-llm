Configures and constructs RPCs with support for JSON and Protocol Buffer formats, enabling client and server communication with custom request and response types. Allows wrapping and unwrapping of values to adapt between different data representation modes. Examples include setting up authentication flows, handling real-time data feeds, and generating client stubs for service integration.",
