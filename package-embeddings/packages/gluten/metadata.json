Operates on `Bigstringaf.t` for efficient byte manipulation and manages protocol state transitions through dedicated functions. Used to implement custom protocol handlers that process incoming data, manage flow control, and handle errors during network communication.",

Works with `Bigstringaf.t` for efficient byte buffer manipulation and tracks connection state through protocol upgrades and closure reporting. Used to implement non-blocking I/O workflows in streaming network applications.",

It supports efficient data extraction via a callback function that processes a bigstring with specified offset and length. It also enables writing data by providing a callback to fill a bigstring, allowing direct manipulation of underlying storage.",
