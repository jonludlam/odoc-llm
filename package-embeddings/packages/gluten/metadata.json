It provides functions to read from and write to a stream, manage protocol upgrades, and handle exceptions, working with types like `Bigstringaf.t` and `Faraday.iovec`. It is used to build network servers that process requests and responses over a streaming I/O interface.",

It provides methods to inspect and perform read/write operations, including yielding control to external handlers, reporting results, and handling shutdowns. Concrete use cases include implementing custom network protocols, managing streaming data transfers, and handling asynchronous I/O with precise control over buffering and execution flow.",
