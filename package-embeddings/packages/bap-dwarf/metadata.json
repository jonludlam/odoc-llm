      "description": "This module parses and manipulates DWARF debugging information in binary programs, providing core data types for tags, attributes, sections, and forms, along with operations for serialization, deserialization, and comparison. It includes utilities for LEB128 encoding and decoding of numeric values, enabling efficient handling of variable-length integers in debug data. You can extract function metadata from stripped binaries, decode attribute values like names and address ranges, and convert DWARF entries into structured formats such as S-expressions. Specific operations include parsing `Info` and `Str` sections, mapping over DWARF entries, and managing binary buffers with endianness-aware decoding.",
