Works with a custom element type and a sequence type that supports indexed access. Used to efficiently compute intersections between sorted sequences by leveraging ordered element comparisons.",

Operates on lists and arrays that are maintained in sorted order. Useful for merging large datasets where one sequence is significantly smaller than the other, such as filtering a small set of keys against a large database.",

Operates on a custom element type and a sequence type that supports random access. Allows for retrieving elements by position, comparing elements directly, and calculating sequence lengths. Enables tasks such as finding common elements between two sorted lists or filtering based on positional data.",
