It works with 1D arrays of double-precision floats in Fortran layout and 64-bit float vectors in C-style layout. Key operations include setting bounds, specifying termination criteria, and iterating toward optimal solutions. Examples include fitting model parameters with constraints and optimizing high-dimensional functions in machine learning.",
