It operates on vectors represented as Bigarray.Array1.t in C layout, allowing direct interaction with the underlying FORTRAN implementation. The `min` and `max` functions perform minimization and maximization of a given objective function, accepting parameters such as bounds, convergence tolerances, and iteration limits, making it suitable for optimization problems in machine learning, numerical analysis, and scientific computing.",

It operates on Fortran-layout vectors and provides functions to minimize or maximize a given function, using its gradient, with support for specifying bounds on variables and convergence criteria. Concrete use cases include parameter estimation in machine learning models and numerical optimization tasks with constraints.",

      "description": "This library implements the L-BFGS-B algorithm for large-scale bound-constrained optimization, supporting both minimization and maximization of objective functions using their gradients. It provides fine-grained control over convergence criteria, output verbosity, and workspace management, while operating on numerical state and workspace structures to expose metrics such as gradient norms and iteration statistics. The core functionality works with vectors in either C or Fortran layout, enabling direct integration with external numerical libraries and facilitating real-time convergence monitoring, adaptive parameter tuning, and performance analysis. Use cases include parameter estimation in machine learning models, scientific computing, and numerical optimization tasks where constraints and large problem sizes demand efficient, adaptive solvers.",
