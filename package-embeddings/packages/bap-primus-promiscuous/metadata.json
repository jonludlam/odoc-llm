It integrates dynamic linking and execution capabilities through its child module, allowing symbolic names to be associated with addresses, TIDs, or identifiers for runtime code manipulation. Main operations include initializing division-by-zero support, linking and resolving symbols, and executing code fragments dynamically. Example uses include testing error-prone arithmetic code, implementing runtime patches, and instrumenting binaries for analysis.",

      "description": "This module handles page fault exceptions during machine code execution by redirecting control to a predefined handler, using memory and register interfaces to inspect and modify execution state. It enables custom memory protection and debugging in emulated environments, allowing, for example, execution to resume from a fault by modifying register values or memory mappings. The child module extends this functionality by managing dynamic linking and execution of code by name, supporting operations like linking, unlinking, and resolving symbols or thread IDs. Together, they allow fault-driven execution strategies, such as dynamically linking and running handler code in response to a page fault.",
