It operates on floats (timestamps) and tuples of (float * float) to handle timezone information, supporting use cases like converting user-inputted date-time strings to standardized UTC values or generating human-readable datetime outputs with timezone context. Specialized functions manage partial datetime parsing and timezone-aware conversions, ensuring flexibility in handling ambiguous or timezone-specific data.",
