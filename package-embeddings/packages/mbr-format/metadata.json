It works with 32-bit integers for geometry components and 64-bit integers for LBA offsets. Use this module when handling legacy disk geometries for bootloaders, disk imaging, or low-level storage manipulation where CHS addressing is required.",

It provides functions to construct a partition with specified LBA start and size, extract sector information, and parse a partition entry from a binary buffer. Concrete use cases include reading and writing partition tables on storage devices, validating disk layouts, and building disk images.",
