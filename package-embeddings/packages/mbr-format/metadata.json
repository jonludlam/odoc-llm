It provides functions to create partitions with specified start and size, convert sector values to 64-bit integers, and decode partition entries from binary buffers. Use cases include parsing and constructing MBR partition tables for disk imaging, bootloaders, or disk management tools.",

It works directly with 32-bit integers for geometry components and 64-bit integers for LBA offsets. It is used to interpret and translate disk addressing schemes for legacy MBR partitioning.",

      "description": "This module provides tools for constructing and manipulating Master Boot Records, including partition layout management and time field handling. It supports creating MBRs from partition lists, serializing and deserializing binary buffers, and working with fixed offsets and sizes for standard layouts. The partition module defines structures for MBR partition entries, enabling creation, parsing, and LBA conversion, while the geometry module handles disk geometry representation, CHS addressing, and LBA-to-CHS translation. Use cases include disk image generation, bootloader development, and low-level partition management using concrete operations like partition table construction, boot sector manipulation, and disk addressing translation.",
