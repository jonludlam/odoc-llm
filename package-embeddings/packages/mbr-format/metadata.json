Works with disk geometry data structured as a record containing sector, head, and cylinder counts. Used to generate valid geometry configurations for small disks and translate LBA addresses into low-level disk coordinates.",

Operates on a private type representing partition metadata, including LBA start, sector count, and boot status.
