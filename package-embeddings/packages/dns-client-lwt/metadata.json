It manages connection state, sends and receives DNS messages over sockets, and integrates with Happy Eyeballs for multi-address connection attempts. It operates on IP addresses, ports, and TLS configurations, and is used to perform asynchronous DNS queries with timeout handling and secure transport options.",

      "description": "This module implements an asynchronous DNS client using Lwt, supporting standard queries like A, AAAA, and MX over plaintext or TLS with Happy Eyeballs integration. It provides structured resolution of domain names to IP addresses and DNS records, handling timeouts, network errors, and secure transport configurations. Key operations include resolving hostnames, querying custom resource records, and managing TLS-secured DNS connections. Example uses include programmatically retrieving IPv6 addresses for a domain or querying TXT records for email verification.",
