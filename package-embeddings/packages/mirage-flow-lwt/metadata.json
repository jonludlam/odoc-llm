It tracks I/O statistics during the transfer and returns them on success or an error if either direction fails. This module is useful for implementing network proxies or tunneling connections between clients and servers.",

It handles errors from both source and destination flows, returning statistics on success or a descriptive error on failure.

It provides utilities to construct flows from refill functions that dynamically source or sink data from fixed or list-based buffer collections, enabling efficient simulation of network protocols, in-memory data streaming, or testing scenarios requiring controlled data flow behavior.",

It provides functions to read a buffer from a flow, write a single buffer or a list of buffers to a flow, and close a flow after flushing pending writes. The module handles errors during reading and writing with detailed error types and pretty-printers, making it suitable for network protocols requiring precise buffer management and flow control.",
