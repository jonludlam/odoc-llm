It supports handling of buffers, sequential data transmission with `write` and `writev`, and proper connection termination with `close`. It is used for implementing network protocols over transport layers like TCP or TLS.",

It works with byte buffers (`Cstruct.t`) and abstract flow handles, providing precise error handling for I/O operations. Concrete use cases include implementing network protocols where partial writes, EOF handling, and controlled connection termination are required, such as in HTTP servers or streaming applications.",
