Operates on buffer types representing raw data and flow objects managing network connections. Reads data into buffers until EOF or connection closure, writes buffers or lists of buffers to flows, and closes connections gracefully.",

Operates on buffer types representing raw data and flow objects encapsulating network connections. Enables handling of network communication by reading data, writing buffers, and gracefully closing or shutting down connection directions.",
