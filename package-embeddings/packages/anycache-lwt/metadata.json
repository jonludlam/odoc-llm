Enables structured error propagation and transformation of asynchronous results through chained operations.",

It operates on the abstract type t, which represents keys in a structured format. This function is used to sort or order key-based data in applications like configuration management or dependency resolution.",

Provides a total ordering function for abstract key types, enabling sorting and comparison in systems that manage structured data. Users can build complex asynchronous workflows with error-aware transformations and organize key-based data efficiently. Examples include managing configuration dependencies and processing asynchronous results with custom error handling.",
