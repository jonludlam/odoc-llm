It supports key operations like standard deviation calculation, tuple restructuring, CSV-based Random Forest training, and prediction with uncertainty estimation. Users can load data from files, train models with configurable parameters, and generate predictions while optionally leveraging parallel execution. Example tasks include analyzing numerical datasets, transforming tuple structures, and building regression or classification models from CSV input with header-parsed columns.",
