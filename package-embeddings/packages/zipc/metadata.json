It provides functions to construct file data from binary strings, decompress data, and access metadata such as compression method, CRC-32 checksum, and file size limits. Concrete use cases include building ZIP archive members from raw data, validating decompressed content via CRC checks, and inspecting ZIP file properties for extraction compatibility.",

It includes operations to normalize paths by ensuring Unix-style separators, enforcing directory endings, and sanitizing paths for ZIP compatibility. The file mode formatting function displays permissions in `ls -l` style, useful for inspecting or logging ZIP entry metadata.",
