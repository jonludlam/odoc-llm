It operates directly on byte strings, providing functions to compress data with optional dictionary support and to decompress data when the original size is known. Typical use cases include efficient data serialization, network transmission, and storage optimization where speed and compression ratio are critical.",

It works with raw memory pointers, strings, and Zstandard context structures (`CCtx`, `DCtx`) for stateful compression and decompression. Concrete use cases include implementing custom compression pipelines, validating compressed data integrity, and managing compression dictionaries for improved ratio in repeated compressions.",
