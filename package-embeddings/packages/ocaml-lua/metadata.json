It handles Lua states, stack values, and userdata through utilities for argument validation, string manipulation, reference tracking, and metaprogramming, while supporting tasks like script execution, module registration, and resource cleanup. Key use cases include embedding Lua interpreters in OCaml applications, safely exchanging data between the two languages, and implementing Lua extensions with robust error handling.",

It provides low-level access to Lua's core functionalities\u2014such as manipulating Lua values (tables, functions, threads, userdata), inspecting and transforming stack elements, and handling garbage collection\u2014while enabling seamless bridging between OCaml and Lua representations. Typical use cases include embedding Lua scripts in OCaml applications, extending Lua with custom OCaml-implemented functions, and managing Lua environments or coroutines programmatically.",
