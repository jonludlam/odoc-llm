It provides conversions between these tags and their string representations, along with a function to check if a string corresponds to a valid raw command. A typical use case involves parsing and emitting raw command markers in formatted output streams, such as when generating documentation or templated text.",

      "description": "This module provides parsing and validation operations for Bracetax markup syntax, focusing on identifying formatting tokens (e.g., bold, italic, list markers) and structural elements (e.g., sections, links, images) within strings. It processes raw string inputs and string lists to extract structured metadata like section hierarchy, image attributes, or list styles, while validating syntax correctness through predicate checks and error reporting for malformed constructs. These capabilities are particularly useful for converting Bracetax-formatted text into typed representations for rendering or further processing.",
