      "description": "This module provides a comprehensive toolkit for building interactive, data-driven user interfaces with rich layout, event, and rendering capabilities. It centers around widgets as core UI elements, supported by structured data types for events, properties, layouts, and text buffers, enabling fine-grained control over appearance, behavior, and interaction. Developers can create modal dialogs, scrollable containers, flex-based layouts, and custom controls like sliders, trees, and entry fields, while leveraging typed property systems, event callbacks, and CSS theming for dynamic styling and responsive design. Example applications include code editors with syntax highlighting, data dashboards with interactive widgets, and form-based interfaces with validation and layout-aware containers.",
