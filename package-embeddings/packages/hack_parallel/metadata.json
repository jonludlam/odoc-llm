      "description": "This library provides a rich set of operations for working with optional values, including predicates for inspection, transformations across multiple options, iterative processing, and value extraction with default handling. It supports monadic workflows through infix operators and standard bind/map functions, enabling concise chaining of fallible computations while offering utilities for aggregation, filtering, and error propagation. Designed for scenarios requiring robust optional value handling, it facilitates both imperative-style iteration and functional composition over `option` types.",
