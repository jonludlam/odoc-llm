It operates on byte sequences and unsigned 64-bit integers to produce random data. Used to seed cryptographic primitives in secure unikernel environments where hardware support is available.",

Operates with types representing entropy sources, handlers for data events, and tokens for handler management. Used to dynamically monitor and interact with entropy generation systems in real-time.",
