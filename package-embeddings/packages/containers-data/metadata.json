It provides imperative operations for creating, modifying, and querying sets, including insertion, removal, membership testing, and set algebra such as union and subset checks, with traversal functions for aggregation and serialization. Child modules refine these capabilities by defining element interfaces, extending set operations, and supporting dynamic collection management. Examples include tracking transient state changes, filtering unique elements from streams, and storing custom data types like records or strings with user-defined equality and hashing.",

Child modules extend this functionality by allowing the creation of field objects that represent individual bits or ranges, enabling users to build layouts for hardware registers, configuration flags, or compact state encodings. For example, a user can define a 32-bit register with named bitfields for individual flags, then read or modify those flags without affecting other bits in the field.",
