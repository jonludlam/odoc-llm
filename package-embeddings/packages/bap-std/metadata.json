It supports argument construction, role assignment, attribute handling, and versioned I/O, while submodules provide ordered collections, maps, sets, and hash tables for organizing arguments with indexed traversal, set algebra, and typed key-value grouping. You can serialize arguments to binary or S-expressions, cache them using digest keys, compare and order them directly, or track dependencies through hash tables with imperative updates. Specific uses include analyzing subroutine interfaces, persisting argument metadata across analysis passes, and transforming low-level parameter sets with structured I/O and conflict resolution.",
