It operates on time and date values represented using the `Timmy.Time.t` and `Timmy.Date.t` types. Use this module to obtain precise time and date information for logging, scheduling, or timestamping events in applications that require local time handling.",

      "description": "This module supports arithmetic, comparison, and validation operations on date values composed of day, month, and year components, with robust handling of overflow, timezones, and weekday calculations. It interconverts between OCaml date representations (`Timmy.Date.t`), JavaScript date objects (`Timmy.Date.js`), and string/tuple/Julian formats, enabling cross-runtime interoperability and precise date serialization. Use cases include clamping dates to valid ranges, formatting for RFC3339 compliance, and performing calendar-aware arithmetic like adding days or determining relative date differences.",

It also supports arithmetic manipulations like adding or subtracting time spans, alongside bidirectional conversions between `Timmy.Time.t`, RFC3339 strings, Ptime, and JavaScript time representations, with timezone-aware formatting for interoperability. These capabilities are ideal for applications requiring robust time calculations, cross-format data exchange, or human-readable logging in distributed systems.",
