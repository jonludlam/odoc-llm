      "description": "This module provides operations for working with ISO weeks, represented as year-week pairs, including creation with validity checks, date conversions, arithmetic (e.g., adding integers to weeks), and comparisons. It supports ordered operations like clamping ranges, extracting min/max values, and formatting/parsing weeks in `YYYY-NN` string form. Use cases include calendar-based scheduling, date range validation, and time-series data processing where strict ISO week definitions are required.",

      "description": "The module offers calendar date manipulation with validated construction, arithmetic (day addition/subtraction), and comparison operations, handling overflow adjustments and timezone conversions. It works with a `t` type representing dates as year-month-day triples, supporting conversions to/from JavaScript date objects, strings, and integer timestamps. This enables use cases like date validation, time-aware comparisons, and interoperable date handling between OCaml and JavaScript environments.",

It supports operations to construct timezones from GMT offsets or custom implementations, and to query the offset at specific dates and times. Concrete use cases include handling historical timezone changes, formatting timestamps with correct local time adjustments, and working with system-native timezone data.",

      "description": "The module organizes backward compatibility logic across multiple versions. It defines version identifiers and comparison operations to manage feature availability. Developers can check if a given version supports specific functionality or migrate between versioned interfaces. For example, code can conditionally enable features based on version thresholds or adapt APIs for older clients.",

It works with `Timmy.Time.t` time points, `Span.t` durations, `Ptime.t`, and JavaScript `Date` objects, ensuring consistent timezone handling and error reporting. Typical use cases include time-based calculations, interoperability with systems using different time representations, and persistent storage or transmission of timestamps.",

Core data types include year-week pairs, year-month-day triples, timezone definitions, and time points with associated spans. Operations span validity-checked arithmetic, conversions between representations, timezone-aware comparisons, and formatting to and from standard string forms. Examples include scheduling events by ISO week, validating date ranges across timezones, converting timestamps for JavaScript interoperability, and managing backward-compatible time-based APIs.",
