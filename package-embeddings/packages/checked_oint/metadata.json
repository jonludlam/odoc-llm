It works with 16-bit signed integer values (`t` type), supporting conversions to/from integers, strings, and polymorphic types, alongside constants like min/max bounds. It is suitable for safety-critical numerical computations, low-level bit manipulation, or scenarios requiring precise control over integer behavior, such as protocol parsing or embedded systems programming.",

It works with 32-bit signed integer values (`t`) and offers two error-handling variants: returning `option` types or raising `Out_of_range` exceptions during arithmetic, shifts, and conversions. Specific use cases include financial computations requiring precise error handling and systems programming where strict numeric bounds are critical.",

It provides both `option`-returning functions for robust error handling and `_exn` variants that raise exceptions on overflow/underflow, along with constants like `min_int` and `max_int` to define the representable range. Typical applications include low-level system programming, binary data manipulation, and domains requiring strict bounds checking or error-resilient integer arithmetic.",
