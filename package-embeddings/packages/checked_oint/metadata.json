      "description": "This module implements arithmetic and bitwise operations, comparisons, and bounds-safe conversions for 8-bit signed integers, using a dedicated type to represent values. Operations like addition, multiplication, and shifts handle overflow or underflow by returning optional values or raising exceptions, while conversions support interoperability with integers, strings, and constants like min/max. It is particularly useful in system-level programming, numerical algorithms requiring explicit error handling, and parsing applications where precise bitwidth and safety guarantees are essential.",

Typical use cases include systems requiring precise numeric control, such as cryptographic algorithms, embedded systems, or financial computations where runtime errors from arithmetic edge cases must be explicitly managed.",
