It works directly with Mirage flows and Lwt_io channels, handling buffer configuration and closure behavior. Concrete use cases include adapting network or file flows for line-based input processing or formatted output in Lwt-based applications.",

      "description": "This module implements low-level I/O operations for file descriptors in a MirageOS-compatible way, providing functions to read from and write to flows using `Cstruct.t` buffers. It supports single-buffer writes, vectorized writes, controlled shutdown of read and write directions, and safe closure of flows. These operations are specifically designed for use with Lwt-based asynchronous networking code, such as handling TCP connections or Unix domain sockets in MirageOS unikernels.",
