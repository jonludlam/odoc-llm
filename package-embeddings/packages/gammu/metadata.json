      "description": "This module retrieves detailed information about a connected mobile device, including battery status, firmware version, hardware identifiers, network registration details, and signal quality. It provides access to structured data such as battery charge levels, network codes, and phone model information through dedicated types like `battery_charge`, `network`, and `phone_model`. Specific use cases include monitoring battery health, identifying connected devices via IMEI, and retrieving current network and signal status for diagnostics or logging.",

It works with SMS data structures like multi-part message containers and metadata records, handling storage locations (SIM/phone) and parsing complex content such as ringtones, EMS, or WAP extensions. Use cases include handling long text messages requiring segmentation, decoding vendor-specific multimedia payloads, and synchronizing message states across devices while respecting memory constraints.",

Works directly with the `t` record type containing year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and timezone fields. Used to manage calendar events, message timestamps, and device synchronization tasks requiring precise time validation and formatting.",

It operates on `info` type values representing debug configurations, and is used to direct and filter debug logging when handling phone data such as contacts, SMS, or calendar entries. Concrete use cases include redirecting debug output to a file, setting verbose logging levels, and enabling global debug settings for consistent diagnostics across operations.",
