It works with the `info` type representing debug configurations and `out_channel` for directing output. Use this module to route debug logs to specific output streams, adjust verbosity levels, or enable/disable debugging for troubleshooting phone data operations like contact or message handling.",

It works with SMS-specific data structures including UDH headers, message state flags, and structured memory status reports for SIM/phone storage. Typical use cases involve managing SMS folders, processing concatenated messages with vendor-specific encodings, and inspecting or deleting messages based on content type or storage constraints.",

It supports structured data types like contacts, SMS messages, and call logs, with functions to read, update, and synchronize this data while respecting string length constraints imposed by the underlying library. The debug module controls logging output for troubleshooting, while the SMS module enables message sending, decoding, and storage management, including multipart messages and encoding formats. Additional modules handle INI configuration files, extract device status information like battery and signal levels, manage call records, and manipulate date-time values for calendar and message timestamps.",
