It works with `Cstruct.t` for binary data input/output and `Secp256k1.Key.secret` and `Secp256k1.Key.public` types for cryptographic keys, encapsulated in a `Bip32.t` structure. Concrete use cases include wallet key management in blockchain applications, deriving extended keys for transactions, and serializing/deserializing keys for storage or transmission.",

It supports key derivation from entropy, child key derivation using 32-bit indices, and serialization/deserialization of keys to and from byte sequences using `Cstruct.t`. The module integrates cryptographic operations such as SHA-256, HMAC-SHA512, and RIPEMD-160 for hashing and authentication, which are essential for deriving and securing keys in wallet systems. Users can generate extended key pairs, derive keys along BIP44 paths, and securely serialize keys for offline storage or transaction signing.",
