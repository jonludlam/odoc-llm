It works with core DFA components like states, transition tables, alphabets, and acceptance conditions, alongside conversions from non-deterministic automata and regular expressions. Key applications include optimizing automata for efficiency, verifying language equivalence, and enabling pattern matching through regex-to-DFA compilation.",
