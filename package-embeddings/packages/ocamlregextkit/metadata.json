It supports operations to build and deconstruct expressions like literals, unions, concatenations, and Kleene stars. Use this module to represent and transform regular expressions programmatically for tasks like pattern analysis or compiler construction.",

      "description": "This module provides operations to construct, analyze, and transform finite automata, including converting regular expressions into automata, pruning unreachable states, checking language emptiness or membership, and merging automata with differing alphabets. It works with states, transitions, and accepting states as core components, supporting traversal via successor/predecessor queries. Use cases include automata-based pattern matching, optimizing automata structure, and generating textual or graphical visualizations for debugging or educational purposes.",

It supports analysis tasks like checking nullability, extracting the alphabet, and generating graphviz output for visualization. Concrete use cases include building and manipulating regular expressions programmatically, optimizing their structure, and integrating with tools that consume graphviz representations.",

The core `dfa` type encapsulates states, transitions, and acceptance conditions, with specialized handling for composite product states during operations. Typical applications include string acceptance testing, automata equivalence verification, and optimizing automata representations for compilation or formal verification tasks.",
