      "description": "This module supports construction, analysis, and transformation of non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs) through operations like state/transitions retrieval, reachability checks, alphabet merging, and pruning of unreachable components. It works with the `nfa` type, enabling both functional and in-place modifications, and includes utilities to visualize NFA structures via human-readable output or Graphviz-compatible formats. Typical use cases involve converting regular expressions to NFAs, optimizing automata structure, or debugging through visual representations.",

It supports operations to build expressions using literals, unions, concatenations, and Kleene stars, enabling precise representation of regex patterns. Concrete use cases include parsing regex strings into structured trees and transforming or analyzing regex components for compilation or optimization.",

It manipulates `dfa` structures with integer or product states, supporting equivalence checks through symmetric comparison or Myhill-Nerode partitions. Applications include formal language processing, reachability analysis, and visualization via Graphviz export for automata-based decision procedures.",

It supports `regex` and `nfa` types with operations like parsing, simplification, and derivative computation, alongside `dfa` manipulation through minimization, complementation, and equivalence checking. Users can convert between regex and automata, optimize structures, and generate visualizations using Graphviz export. Specific tasks include compiling regex patterns into NFAs, minimizing DFAs for efficient execution, and analyzing language properties through algebraic transformations.",
