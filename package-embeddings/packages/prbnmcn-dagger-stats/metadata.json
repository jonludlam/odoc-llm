      "description": "Creates a generator for categorical distributions with specified probabilities as rational numbers. It works with arrays of value-probability pairs where probabilities are represented using the `Q.t` type. This function is useful for sampling from a finite set of outcomes with exact rational probability weights.",

It works with the `Stats_dist.Gen.t` type, enabling sequential composition of random value generators. Use it to build complex stochastic models by chaining distributions and transformations.",

      "description": "This module provides functions to compute probability density functions (PDFs) and log-PDFs for statistical distributions like Poisson, Gaussian, exponential, binomial, gamma, and mixtures, with support for multi-dimensional data. It operates on numerical types (floats, integers), arrays, and structured inputs (e.g., tuples), using log-space computations to ensure numerical stability in scenarios like probabilistic modeling or combining independent components. Specific use cases include statistical inference, simulation, and machine learning tasks requiring precise density estimation or log-probability calculations.",

It operates on `Gen.t` generators, which produce random values, and includes utilities for combining generators into tuples or handling weighted categorical distributions with rational probabilities. Typical applications include probabilistic simulations, randomized algorithms, and statistical modeling requiring precise control over sampling behavior.",
