It provides functions to connect to an SMTP server, send commands like HELO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, and DATA, and send complete email messages with specified sender, recipients, and body. The module works with string-based addresses and a custom `request` type to model SMTP commands, returning server responses as `Ok` or `Failure` with status codes and messages. Use cases include sending plain-text emails programmatically and implementing custom email delivery workflows.",

It provides functions for establishing a connection, authenticating, sending mail data, and closing the session, working with email addresses, message payloads, and network streams. The core functionality includes sending transactional emails, notifications, or integrating with email services programmatically. A submodule handles SMTP client operations, allowing connection to an SMTP server and sending commands like HELO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, and DATA, with support for structured email addresses via another submodule that provides parsing, validation, and normalization through `of_string` and `to_string`. An asynchronous submodule manages I/O operations using custom channel types, enabling non-blocking SMTP communication and line-by-line handling of server responses. You can use this module to send plain-text emails programmatically, implement custom email delivery workflows, or build a robust SMTP client with support for structured addresses and asynchronous I/O.",

      "description": "This module implements SMTP client operations for sending emails over Unix-based network connections, supporting direct interaction with SMTP servers using standard commands like HELO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, and DATA. It provides structured handling of email addresses through the `Addr` submodule, which defines a type `t` for validated email addresses and conversion functions between strings and typed representations. You can use it to programmatically send complete email messages with specified senders, recipients, and bodies over a network connection. The `Addr` module is particularly useful for safely parsing and formatting email addresses when constructing or validating SMTP requests and responses.",
