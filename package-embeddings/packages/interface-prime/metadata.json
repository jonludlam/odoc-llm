It supports sequencing computations that return monadic values, transforming and combining them using `fmap`, `seq`, and the `>>` operator. Concrete use cases include handling effectful computations like I/O, error propagation, or stateful operations in a composable way.",

It provides functions like `bind`, `return`, and `fmap` to chain operations, sequence lists of results, and map over values, while `fail` and `lift` handle error creation and conversion from another monad. Use it to compose error-prone operations like parsing or file reading, where each step depends on the success of the previous.",
