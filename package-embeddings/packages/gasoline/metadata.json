It supports character and string manipulation, buffer expansion, locale-specific number formatting, and type-safe value serialization, along with database access and priority-based content insertion. Operations include writing to output channels, building text buffers, formatting numbers according to regional rules, and serializing structured data. Examples include generating localized financial reports, constructing log entries with dynamic content, and persisting priority-based processing states.",
