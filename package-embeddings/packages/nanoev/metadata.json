It provides functions to register callbacks for readability and writability of file descriptors, schedule delayed actions, and manage the lifecycle of the event loop and associated resources. Concrete use cases include building network servers that handle multiple connections concurrently or implementing custom I/O multiplexing logic with precise timing control.",
