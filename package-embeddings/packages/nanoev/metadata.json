It supports registering callbacks for readability and writability of file descriptors, scheduling deferred actions, and managing event loop lifecycle.

Provides functions for registering file descriptors, managing timer events, and dispatching callbacks when events occur. Works directly with file descriptors, timer structures, and user-defined callback handlers. Useful for building custom event-driven networking or concurrency systems where fine-grained control over event sources is required.",

Its core functionality includes managing event sources and dispatching handlers when I/O or timer events occur, with support for custom event-driven systems. The child module extends this by exposing low-level operations for fine-grained control over file descriptors, timers, and callback dispatching. Together, they allow building efficient network servers or system tools that react to asynchronous events with precise control over concurrency and I/O.",
