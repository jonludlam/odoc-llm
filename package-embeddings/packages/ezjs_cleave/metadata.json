It works with JavaScript objects representing Cleave instances, configuration records for format rules, and string-based region codes to handle localized phone number parsing. Typical use cases include enhancing web forms with real-time credit card validation, phone number normalization with region-specific formatting, and date/number entry masking in browser-based OCaml applications.",
