It supports parsing and pretty-printing spans in S-expression format, enabling structured data interchange and configuration parsing. Concrete use cases include persisting time spans to disk, transmitting them over networks, or embedding them in larger S-expression-based data formats.",

It operates on `Timedesc.Time_zone.t` values and standard types like strings and S-expressions, supporting direct parsing and output. The `Db` submodule gives access to a built-in database of time zones, allowing lookups by name or abbreviation. For example, you can load a time zone from a string like \"America/New_York\", convert it to an S-expression for storage, later parse it back, and use the database to resolve system time zone settings.",

Submodules handle specific conversions for each time component, such as parsing a time span from an S-expression, serializing a date to a string, or converting a time zone to and from a string like \"America/New_York\". You can, for example, serialize a timestamp for logging, load a time zone from a config file, or transmit a time value over a protocol in S-expression form.",
