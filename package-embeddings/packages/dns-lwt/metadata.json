It handles shared and unique resource records, supporting operations like probing for hostname uniqueness, announcing records, and processing incoming packets. Use cases include service discovery on local networks, such as advertising a web server's A record or handling DNS-based service registration with conflict resolution.",

      "description": "This module defines the interface for handling DNS requests by parsing raw packets into a context, processing queries, and marshaling responses back into wire format. It works with `Cstruct.t` buffers for packet input/output and `context` values that encapsulate per-request state. Concrete use cases include implementing custom DNS responders, supporting DNS extensions like DNSCurve, and integrating with network stacks for handling DNS traffic.",

      "description": "This module defines the transport layer operations required by the mDNS responder for handling network I/O. It includes functions to allocate buffer space, send DNS packets to a specified endpoint, and introduce delays during probing or announcement phases. It works directly with DNS packets represented as `Cstruct.t` and endpoint information via `Mdns_responder.ip_endpoint`. Use cases include sending unicast and multicast DNS responses, managing buffer allocation for outgoing packets, and implementing timing control during hostname probing.",

      "description": "This module implements a DNS server that processes incoming packets using zone file data, supporting query handling and customizable packet parsing. It works with DNS packets, IP endpoints, and zone file strings, providing functions to chain processing logic and handle fallback behavior. The server can be configured to serve DNS records from preloaded zone files, implement DNS extensions like DNSCurve, or route queries between multiple zone configurations. By defining how raw packets are parsed into a context, how queries are processed, and how responses are marshaled back into wire format, it enables custom DNS responders and integration with network stacks.",

It provides functions to send and receive DNS packets, handle timeouts, and manage resource cleanup during DNS queries. The module works with DNS packets, domain names, IP addresses, and query types, supporting operations like hostname-to-IP lookups (`gethostbyname`) and IP-to-hostname lookups (`gethostbyaddr`). It is used to perform DNS resolution over arbitrary transports by plugging in the appropriate communication functions.",

      "description": "This module implements a Multicast DNS responder that processes incoming queries and replies with matching records from a zone file, supporting both shared and unique resource records. It provides operations to announce records, probe for hostname uniqueness, handle conflicts, and process packets, working with IP endpoints and requiring a transport implementation for network communication. Child modules handle zone parsing and DNS response management, enabling use cases like advertising services on local networks, while the transport module manages buffer allocation, packet sending, and timing control during probing. Example usage includes creating a responder from a zone buffer, probing and announcing a unique A record, and processing incoming mDNS packets to generate appropriate responses.",
