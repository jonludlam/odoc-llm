It supports loading zone data from strings or a DNS database, managing unique and shared records, and handling probing and announcement sequences required by the mDNS protocol.

It provides functions to send and receive DNS packets, resolve queries with support for DNSSEC, and perform name and address lookups. The core operations work with DNS packets, domain names, and IP addresses, using Lwt for asynchronous execution. Use cases include implementing custom DNS clients, integrating DNS lookups into network applications, and handling DNS responses with user-defined transport logic.",

It supports operations like `process_of_zonebuf` for loading DNS zones and `compose` for chaining fallback behaviors, enabling features like DNSCurve extensions. The core functions work with DNS packets, IP endpoints, and processor modules to handle query resolution and response generation.",
