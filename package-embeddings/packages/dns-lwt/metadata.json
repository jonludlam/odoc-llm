Provides functions for parsing wire-format packets, constructing queries, and inspecting response data. Used to implement DNS clients and servers that require precise control over query construction and response analysis.",

Works with DNS packet structures, query classes, types, and domain names to perform lookups. Specifically supports host name to IP address resolution and reverse lookups via asynchronous Lwt operations.",
