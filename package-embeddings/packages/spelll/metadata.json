It provides `edit_distance` for measuring the difference between two strings, and automaton construction functions like `of_string` and `of_list` to create structures that accept strings within a given distance from a reference. The `match_with` function tests whether a string is within the allowed distance of the reference string, and `Index` supports efficient one-to-many matching operations, such as searching a dictionary for all strings close to a given query.",

It supports operations like comparing strings under various distance metrics and efficiently matching strings within a bounded edit distance. The child module builds a fuzzy search index for storing and querying key-value pairs with exact or approximate matches, enabling features like auto-complete and spell checking. Together, they allow adding, searching, and retrieving string data with flexible matching options, handling both small-scale comparisons and large-scale similarity searches.",

Core operations include computing edit distances, constructing automata for bounded-distance matching, and building indexes that support efficient approximate searches over large datasets. It enables tasks like spell checking by identifying close matches, auto-complete suggestions with typo tolerance, and indexed lookups that retrieve key-value pairs based on partial or inexact string queries. The combination of direct distance calculations, automaton-based matching, and indexed storage supports both individual comparisons and scalable similarity searches.",
