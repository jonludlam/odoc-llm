It works with custom string and character types provided by the `Str` module, supporting operations like building automata from strings or lists, matching strings against automata, and debugging automaton structures. Concrete use cases include implementing fuzzy search, typo correction, and auto-complete features with configurable tolerance for character-level differences.",
