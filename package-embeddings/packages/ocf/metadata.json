It provides functions to construct custom wrappers, convert JSON values safely, and handle parsing errors by triggering invalid value callbacks. Concrete use cases include defining configuration value parsers and serializers that integrate with JSON-based configuration files.",

      "description": "This module provides ordered string-keyed maps with operations for key-value management, ordered traversal, and structural transformations like merging, splitting, and filtering. It works with maps (`Ocf.SMap.t`) and sequences (`Stdlib.Seq.t`) to enable bulk updates, range-based iteration, and ordered conversions between data formats. Use cases include handling structured configuration data where key ordering must be preserved, efficiently applying bulk changes from sequences, and performing key-value-aware transformations during data processing.",

It provides robust parsing, error handling, and path-based access to configuration values, along with conversion to command-line arguments, catering to applications requiring strict configuration validation and dynamic reconfiguration with detailed error reporting.",
