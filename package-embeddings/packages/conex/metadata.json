It operates on strings, encoded wire data, and maps of identifiers to digests, producing verified identity mappings and error reports. Concrete use cases include validating artifact signatures using preloaded keys and detecting digest mismatches during verification workflows.",

It supports signature validation, digest generation, and identity mapping verification, operating on strings, encoded data, and key-value mappings. Users can verify artifact signatures, detect digest mismatches, and ensure data integrity using string-based keys and signatures. Example workflows include validating signed software artifacts and confirming data authenticity through preloaded keys.",
