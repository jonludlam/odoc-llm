It allows retrieving the number of available CPU cores and setting the core on which the current thread runs. Useful for optimizing performance in parallel computations or real-time systems by pinning threads to specific cores.",

It supports direct memory mapping from strings, efficient byte-level comparisons, and serialization of arbitrary values to and from byte arrays. Concrete use cases include binary data processing, memory-mapped I/O, and handling low-level network or file formats requiring precise byte layout.",

      "description": "The module implements parallelized mapping, folding, and iteration operations for lists and arrays, optimized for multicore systems with dynamic load balancing through configurable chunk sizes. It supports efficient processing of float arrays via dedicated primitives and enables fine-grained control over parallelism granularity and core affinity. These capabilities are particularly useful for compute-intensive tasks like numerical simulations or data processing pipelines where work distribution and memory efficiency are critical. Debugging tools for parallel execution diagnostics further aid in optimizing performance-critical applications.",

It includes a function for logging errors with formatted messages and creating temporary file descriptors. These functions support tasks like processing large datasets efficiently, handling error reporting, and managing temporary files in system programming.",
