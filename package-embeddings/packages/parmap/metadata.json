Works with Bigarray-based types for efficient storage and access of raw bytes and 64-bit floats. Used for low-level data serialization, buffer management, and high-performance data transfers.",

It supports specialized handling of float arrays for high-performance numerical computations and includes mechanisms for core pinning and load balancing. Use cases include processing large datasets or computationally intensive tasks where efficient multithreading is critical, such as scientific simulations or data transformation pipelines.",
