It operates on row-based matrices and vectors, utilizing dense matrices (`dsmat`) for advanced visualizations such as heatmaps, probability plots, and sparsity patterns. Designed for scientific data analysis, it facilitates tasks ranging from statistical plotting (e.g., histograms, Q-Q plots) to 3D surface rendering and image display.",

      "description": "This module enables visualization of numerical data through 2D and 3D plots, supporting configuration of plot properties, annotations, and multiple plot types. It operates on dense matrices and vectors, allowing creation of line, scatter, bar, and surface plots, along with advanced visualizations like heatmaps and Q-Q plots. Users can render 3D surfaces, display images, and annotate plots with text or shapes. For example, you can generate a 3D surface plot from a matrix, overlay annotations, or create a histogram from a data vector.",
