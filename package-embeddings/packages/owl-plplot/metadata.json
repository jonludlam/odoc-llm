      "description": "The module offers configuration and customization operations for 2D/3D visualizations, working with numerical data matrices (`dsmat`) and plot handles to adjust titles, colors, scales, and output settings. It enables creation of diverse graphical representations, including line plots, histograms, heatmaps, and statistical charts like boxplots, with support for geometric shapes and surface/mesh plots. Use cases span data analysis, scientific visualization, and interactive plotting, leveraging parameterized styling for clarity and precision.",
