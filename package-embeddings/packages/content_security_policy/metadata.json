It supports merging policies with `combine` and `reduce`, enabling the union of allowed sources and directives, and includes specific constructors like `report_uri`, `base_uri`, and `fetch` to define granular security rules. These functions are used to build policies that control resource loading and request handling in web applications, such as restricting script sources or specifying report endpoints.",

It allows constructing policies that specify allowed content sources per fetch type (e.g., scripts, styles), supports policy merging, and generates CSP header strings. Concrete use cases include restricting script loading to trusted hosts, blocking or upgrading insecure requests, and defining report endpoints for policy violations.",
