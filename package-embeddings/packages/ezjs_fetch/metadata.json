It provides operations to process responses into streams, buffers, or text, along with utilities for chaining promises and results. This facilitates client-side OCaml applications in handling web API interactions, file uploads, and streamed data processing via JavaScript's Fetch API.",

It operates on byte streams using JavaScript-compatible interfaces for handling asynchronous data flow. Concrete use cases include processing HTTP responses in chunks, implementing custom stream encodings, and managing backpressure in client-side data pipelines.",

      "description": "This module enables constructing and managing HTTP requests and responses in JavaScript-compatible environments, focusing on asynchronous data handling. It works with request and response objects like `request_body` and `response_js`, supporting operations such as streaming payloads with custom handlers, converting responses to text or binary formats (e.g., array buffers), and configuring requests with headers and options. It is particularly useful for client-side applications requiring efficient streaming of large datasets or real-time data processing via callback-driven workflows.",
