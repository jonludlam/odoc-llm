It handles numeric encodings like varint, zigzag, and bits32/64, supports nested message decoding, and includes validation to raise errors for incomplete or invalid inputs. Specific use cases include parsing structured data streams, extracting optional fields from wrapper types, and processing hierarchical protobuf messages efficiently.",

It handles arbitrary types by wrapping values in curly brackets and specializes in formatting collections and wrapped types for controlled output. This is particularly useful in debugging, logging, or generating human-readable representations of complex data structures.",
