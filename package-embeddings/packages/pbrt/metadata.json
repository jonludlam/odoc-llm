      "description": "This module provides low-level decoding operations for parsing Protocol Buffers binary formats, handling varint/zigzag integers, 32/64-bit floats, strings, bytes, and nested messages. It operates on a decoder state (`t`) that tracks input buffers and position, supporting memory-efficient substring/subbyte extraction and structured error propagation for malformed data. Key use cases include deserializing protobuf-encoded data streams with strict validation and handling optional/wrapper types like `int32` or `string` that may be absent or invalid.",

Operates on standard OCaml lists and arbitrary state values. Useful for processing protobuf message fields in reverse order during serialization or traversal.",

It operates on an internal buffer (`t`) to process primitive types (integers, floats, booleans, strings, bytes) and their optional wrappers, including transformations for efficient serialization. Specific use cases include handling optional byte sequences with Protobuf's wrapping logic and encoding numeric fields with variable-length or signed representations for compact wire formats.",

It supports operations like adding elements, converting to arrays or lists, and applying functions across elements, all while maintaining efficient memory usage. It is particularly useful for handling repeated fields in protobuf messages where performance and compact storage are critical.",
