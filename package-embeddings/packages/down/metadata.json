      "description": "This module customizes OCaml toplevel behavior through `set_top`, works with the `TOP` module type, and exposes the Unicode version for terminal width hints via `unicode_version`. It includes `tty_test` for interactive terminal input parsing tests, and collaborates with child modules that handle low-level input and file execution, such as reading input with custom behavior and evaluating source files. Together, they enable building and testing interactive REPL environments with precise control over input handling and script execution. For example, you can set a custom toplevel implementation, test terminal input parsing interactively, or evaluate OCaml source files silently during a session.",

It supports operations like listing existing sessions, loading session content with optional silence, recording and saving or appending phrases to sessions, and stepping through session code interactively. Concrete use cases include resuming past REPL sessions, creating reusable code snippets from files, and interactively debugging or reviewing code execution step-by-step.",

It provides direct control over display settings, such as disabling ANSI effects, and integrates submodules for toplevel behavior, history editing, and session recording. Users can set custom toplevel implementations, test terminal input parsing, evaluate files silently, or step through recorded sessions interactively. Specific examples include loading and replaying past sessions, editing command history with an external editor, and customizing terminal output for better readability during interactive development.",
