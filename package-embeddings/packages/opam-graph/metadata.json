Works with any value type `'a` and produces a result suitable for composing with functions expecting optional metadata. Useful when preparing node or edge data for SVG rendering where annotations are conditionally applied.",

      "description": "This module generates interactive SVG visualizations of dependency graphs, creating styled shapes, text labels, and edges that reflect node relationships and support dynamic interactions like hover and click events. It processes graph data from `Opam_graph`, applies layout algorithms such as spiral or grid arrangements using positional coordinates (`Gg.v2`), and generates hitboxes for interactivity. The main data types include nodes with positional and styling metadata, and edges with connection and annotation details. A child module provides utilities to adapt values into optional metadata tuples, enabling conditional styling or interactivity during rendering, such as dynamically attaching tooltips or event handlers to graph elements.",

It processes graph data into structured layouts using positional coordinates (`Gg.v2`), styled nodes and edges, and hitbox generation, with operations for converting graphs into visual outputs such as HTML documents with embedded CSS or DOT files for external rendering. Examples include generating an SVG with interactive tooltips, exporting a dependency graph as a DOT file for OPAM, or creating a styled HTML page showing package associations. Utilities are provided to adapt metadata for conditional styling and interactivity during rendering.",

It includes utilities for converting between maps and sequences, enabling efficient traversal and bulk updates, while offering structural queries and comparisons for map analysis. These capabilities make it suitable for managing hierarchical or dependency-driven data where string-identified entities require dynamic association and manipulation.",

It works with maps of package names to dependency sets and graph representations, allowing tasks such as resolving dependencies and constructing dependency graphs. The submodule for switch export processes metadata into dependency graphs, while the visualization submodule generates interactive SVG, HTML, and DOT outputs with styled nodes and dynamic interactions. Another submodule handles associative data structures with string keys, providing dictionary operations and transformations for managing hierarchical or dependency-driven data.",
