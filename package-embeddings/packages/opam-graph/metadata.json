Works with graph data structures and association nodes, enabling precise manipulation and output formatting. Used to generate human-readable graph representations and facilitate data conversion between different graph models.",

The module works with any type `'a` and can optionally include a value of type `'b`. It is used to represent results that may lack a secondary component. For example, it can track a primary computation result while indicating no additional data is available.",

It includes types for representing tags, attributes, and content, along with operations to construct and modify HTML fragments. Users can create simple elements, attach attributes, and combine parts into structured output. Example tasks include generating a paragraph with inline text or embedding a link with specified properties.",
