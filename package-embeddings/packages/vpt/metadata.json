      "description": "Calculates the symmetric distance between two instances of type t, ensuring adherence to metric properties including non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, and the triangle inequality. It operates on custom numeric or structured data represented by t, suitable for geometric or comparative analysis. Used to compare points in a metric space, such as coordinates in a 2D plane or embedded vectors in machine learning models.",

      "description": "The module provides array manipulation, transformation, and aggregation functions, including element-wise operations, sorting, and sequence conversions, primarily working with OCaml arrays and float arrays. It addresses concurrency concerns by highlighting non-atomic operations and data race risks, especially with float arrays where byte-level copying and 32-bit architecture limitations may lead to inconsistent results, requiring synchronization for reliable parallel processing. Use cases include scenarios needing parallel array operations, handling multi-dimensional arrays, or precise float value management.",
