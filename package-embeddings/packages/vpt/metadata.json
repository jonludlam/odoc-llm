It supports operations like creating a tree from a list of points, finding the nearest neighbor, retrieving points within a tolerance, and checking tree validity. Concrete use cases include spatial indexing for geographic data or clustering algorithms requiring fast distance-based queries.",

It supports OCaml arrays and matrices with functions for initialization, in-place mutation, functional mapping, folding over indexed elements, pairwise array operations, and statistical analysis, alongside utilities for sorting, shuffling, and sequence conversion. Typical applications include numerical computations requiring efficient array creation and modification, data processing pipelines leveraging folds and filters, and statistical methods utilizing bootstrapping or min/max aggregation with default values.",
