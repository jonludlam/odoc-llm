It supports operations like creating a tree with specified quality, finding nearest neighbors, retrieving points within a tolerance, and checking tree validity. It works directly with point data structures provided by the parameter module, requiring a proper metric for distance calculations.",

It works with any type `t` that supports a distance metric adhering to the triangle inequality. Concrete use cases include representing spatial points and calculating distances for nearest-neighbor searches in metric spaces.",

      "description": "This module organizes data in a vantage-point tree for efficient nearest-neighbor and range queries in arbitrary metric spaces. It builds hierarchical structures from point data, enabling fast similarity searches, clustering, and distance-based filtering. The core API supports tree construction, nearest-neighbor lookups, and range queries, while the point interface defines distance metrics that ensure correctness under the triangle inequality. Example uses include searching high-dimensional vectors or geographic coordinates with customizable distance functions.",
