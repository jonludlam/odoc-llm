      "description": "This module provides a specialized map implementation for string keys with extended operations like merging with custom conflict resolution, list-valued map manipulations, and ordered traversal capabilities. It works with polymorphic ordered maps and sequences of key-value pairs, supporting transformations such as filtered folds, bidirectional iteration, and range-based construction. These features are particularly useful for managing hierarchical data structures and composing complex SCAD script configurations where ordered key-value relationships and precise merge semantics are critical.",

      "description": "This module enables constructing and manipulating 3D/2D geometric models using typed vector operations, boolean combinations (union, difference, intersection), and transformations (affine, scaling, rotation). It operates on dimensional data structures like `V2`, `V3`, polygons, meshes, and paths, supporting advanced modeling techniques such as minkowski sums, hull generation, and extrusion. Typical applications include generating precise CAD models for 3D printing or simulation, with end-to-end type safety ensuring valid OpenSCAD script output.",

      "description": "This module exports SCAD scripts and renders 2D and 3D models into formats like PNG, STL, and SVG, supporting camera configuration, color schemes, and projections. It includes helpers for validating and handling file extensions, and uses a specialized string-keyed map submodule to manage ordered, mergeable configuration data with custom conflict resolution and list-valued operations. The map supports range-based construction, filtered folds, and bidirectional iteration, making it ideal for composing and manipulating complex SCAD model hierarchies. Together, these components enable programmatic generation of high-quality visualizations and manufacturing files from OCaml-defined CAD models.",

It applies a given styling function to each element, allowing distinct visual identification of components like path segments or mesh faces. Use it to debug spatial constructions by generating color-coded or sized representations of 2D paths, 3D paths, or triangular meshes.",

It allows precise color representation using floating-point RGB values or hex strings with optional alpha channels. Use cases include setting material colors in 3D models, generating visually distinct components, and exporting color data for rendering or visualization tools.",
