Works with `Zmq_eio.Socket.t` instances configured for monitoring. Useful for tracking connection lifecycles or detecting disconnections in concurrent network services.",

It provides functions for handling single and multi-part messages, socket conversion, and closure, all without blocking concurrent threads. Use this module to implement asynchronous communication patterns like request-response, pub-sub, or pipeline topologies with ZeroMQ sockets in an Eio-based concurrency context.",

It supports sending and receiving both raw strings and `Zmq.Msg.t` messages, including multi-part messages, socket conversion, and clean closure. Use it to build concurrent networked applications such as distributed task queues, real-time data pipelines, or event-driven microservices using ZeroMQ's pub-sub, req-rep, or push-pull patterns.",
