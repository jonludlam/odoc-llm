It works with monitored ZeroMQ sockets and handles events such as connection establishment, termination, or errors. Use this to observe socket state changes asynchronously in event-driven networking applications.",

It provides core operations for sending, receiving, and closing sockets, while its submodules enable event monitoring and asynchronous routing. The monitoring submodule captures connection and error events asynchronously, enabling real-time socket state tracking. The router submodule facilitates non-blocking request-response interactions using string-based identifiers for message routing.",
