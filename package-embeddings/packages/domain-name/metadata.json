      "description": "This module offers standard set operations like union, intersection, and difference, alongside transformations, ordered iteration, and membership checks for collections of domain names. It works with sets of `Domain_name.t` values, enforcing consistent ordering for comparison and conversion to/from lists or sequences, which is useful for DNS management, domain validation, or hierarchical analysis tasks. Utilities include safe element retrieval, partitioning, and sequence-based construction for efficient processing of ordered domain name data.",

It supports use cases like DNS service group management, access control list operations, and ordered enumeration of service records, leveraging a set structure (`Domain_name.Service_set.t`) that maintains elements in a consistent, comparable order.",

It supports transformations via mapping and folding, and facilitates bulk processing through conversions to and from ordered sequences. Such functionality suits network applications requiring precise management of host name collections, such as DNS filtering or routing policy implementations.",

It supports transformations, filtering, and structural comparisons over key-value pairs where values can be arbitrary data types, with all operations preserving the total ordering of domain name keys. Typical applications include DNS resolution systems, hierarchical domain-based routing policies, and configuration management where ordered domain name keys dictate precedence.",

It enables case-insensitive comparison, hierarchical composition, and DNS-order sorting, while its submodules offer ordered sets and maps for managing domain collections with union, intersection, membership checks, and efficient traversal. Specific capabilities include DNS filtering, service group management, access control, and routing policy implementations through typed, ordered domain keys and bulk operations on sequences. The bundled utilities support safe element retrieval, ordered enumeration, and transformations tailored for network applications requiring precise domain-based data handling.",
