Provides tools for converting, analyzing, and manipulating logical constructs, including bit vectors, lists, and custom data types, while supporting serialization, simplification, and proof state tracking. Examples include logging application events, extracting version details, analyzing Boolean expressions, and managing array constraints in symbolic execution.",

It leverages type aliases for Z3's core elements\u2014like symbols, declarations, and error codes\u2014to streamline interactions with the solver's internal API. These operations are critical for tasks like serializing Z3 states, debugging internal logic, or extending Z3's functionality through custom type handling.",

      "description": "This module provides low-level operations for configuring, managing, and interacting with Z3's theorem-proving infrastructure, including context setup, parameter tuning, and resource cleanup. It works with Z3-specific data structures like abstract syntax trees (ASTs), contexts, sorts, parameters, and symbolic expressions to enable logical formula construction, arithmetic/bitwise manipulation, and constraint solving. Use cases span theorem proving, model evaluation, SMT-LIB parsing, and handling complex types such as bitvectors, arrays, floating-point numbers, and regular expressions.",
