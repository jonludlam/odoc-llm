Tracks events with named markers and arrays of integers, and manages hook functions for pre- and post-execution actions. Used to instrument code execution for profiling or logging purposes.",

Supports initializing environments with custom configurations and executing hook functions before and after code segments. Enables reading and writing structured data, such as point definitions, and logging execution traces. Can serialize runtime states to files and reconstruct them for analysis or debugging.",
