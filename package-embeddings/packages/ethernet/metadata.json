It works with MAC addresses, Ethernet frames, and Cstruct buffers, supporting protocols like IPv4, IPv6, and ARP through demultiplexing. Concrete use cases include sending custom Ethernet packets, filtering traffic based on MAC addresses, and processing incoming frames for higher-layer protocols.",

It provides functions to write Ethernet frames with specified source and destination MAC addresses, handle incoming frames via protocol-specific callbacks for ARP, IPv4, and IPv6, and retrieve interface properties like MAC address and MTU. It works directly with `Cstruct.t` buffers for frame payloads, `Macaddr.t` for addresses, and integrates with a lower-level network device module `N`.",

It operates on `Cstruct.t` buffers for low-level memory manipulation and provides precise control over Ethernet header serialization and deserialization. Use cases include network packet inspection, crafting custom Ethernet frames, and parsing incoming network data for further protocol processing.",

It supports encoding and decoding Ethernet headers, determining packet types, and integrating with protocol-specific processing through demultiplexing. The module enables tasks such as crafting custom Ethernet frames, filtering traffic by MAC address, and inspecting or transmitting raw network packets. It integrates with network devices and supports higher-layer protocols like IPv4, IPv6, and ARP through callback handling and interface property access.",
