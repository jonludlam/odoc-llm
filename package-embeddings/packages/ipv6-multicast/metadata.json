      "description": "This module provides functions to create and manage IPv6 multicast sockets, supporting operations like socket creation with specific domains (`Unix`, `Inet`, `Inet6`) and types (`stream`, `dgram`, `raw`, `seqpacket`). It works with socket data types that represent different communication domains and socket types, along with protocol specifications. Concrete use cases include setting up UDP-based multicast receivers and transmitters in IPv6 networks, binding to specific interfaces, and controlling multicast group membership.",

It provides operations to set and get multicast interface, TTL/hops, loopback, and group membership on both IPv4 and IPv6 sockets. These options are used to control multicast transmission and reception, such as joining or leaving a multicast group, setting the interface for outgoing multicast packets, or limiting the scope of multicast traffic.",

It operates on a single abstract data type `t`, representing IPv6 multicast interface identifiers. Concrete use cases include parsing interface names from configuration files, validating interface indices, and converting between numeric and string forms for network communication.",
