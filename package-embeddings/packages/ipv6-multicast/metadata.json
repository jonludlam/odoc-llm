It operates on a single abstract data type `t`, representing IPv6 multicast interface indices. Concrete use cases include parsing interface indices from configuration strings and converting them to numeric types for system calls or network operations.",

It provides conversions to and from `Unix.sockaddr` and binary representations using `Cstruct.t`. Concrete use cases include constructing multicast socket addresses for network communication and serializing them for transmission or storage.",

It works with domain types such as Unix, Inet, and Inet6, and socket types including stream, dgram, raw, and seqpacket. Concrete use cases include implementing multicast communication in network services, such as real-time data distribution or service discovery protocols.",

      "description": "This module enables IPv6 multicast communication through socket operations like binding, connecting, and sending or receiving byte buffers and Cstruct.t values, with support for control flags. It provides core functions for handling multicast data transmission and integrates submodules for interface index conversion, socket address manipulation, socket option configuration, and socket management. You can build multicast group listeners, send datagrams across interfaces, and handle incoming packets with precise flag handling, while also constructing and serializing socket addresses or configuring multicast settings like TTL and loopback. Direct API functions work alongside submodules to support use cases such as real-time data distribution and service discovery across Unix, Inet, and Inet6 domains.",
