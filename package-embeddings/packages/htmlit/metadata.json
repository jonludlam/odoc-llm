It supports building and manipulating HTML trees using types like `t` for nodes, including element constructors, text nodes, and splices for list-like structures. Use it to generate HTML programmatically with precise control over structure and attributes, especially when composing complex or dynamic content.",

It provides common attributes like `href`, `id`, `tabindex`, and `disabled`, along with utilities for optional attributes and numeric values. Designed for safe HTML generation, it ensures proper escaping of UTF-8 encoded content while allowing dynamic attribute assembly in element construction workflows.",

It operates on a typed representation of HTML content, supporting operations like rendering to strings, assembling full pages, and low-level AST manipulation through specialized combinators. Designed for programmatic HTML generation, it ensures safe data escaping while requiring UTF-8 input, and is suited for building semantic web interfaces, dynamic document assembly, and structured markup workflows.",

It is used for building semantic web interfaces, dynamic HTML assembly, and safe programmatic generation of documents with proper data escaping.",
