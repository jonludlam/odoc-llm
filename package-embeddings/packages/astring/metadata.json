      "library": "astring",
      "description": "This module provides ordered traversal, transformation, and querying operations for associative collections with string keys, supporting safe value retrieval, predicate-based searches, and bidirectional conversion with standard library maps. It works with immutable string-keyed maps (`t` type) that store arbitrary values, emphasizing ergonomic manipulation through functions like `find`, `map`, `filter`, and `merge`, while ensuring compatibility with OCaml's standard map interfaces. Typical use cases include configuration management, environment variable handling, and data processing pipelines where ordered key traversal and string-centric associations are critical.",

      "description": "This module provides functions to check and transform US-ASCII characters, including predicates for digit, hex digit, letter, whitespace, and control character detection, as well as case conversion and character escaping. It operates directly on `char` values, focusing on bytes in the US-ASCII range [0x00;0x7F], and is suitable for parsing and validating ASCII-based protocols or file formats. Use cases include filtering valid ASCII input, normalizing case in identifiers, and escaping non-printable characters for logging or output.",

      "library": "astring",
      "description": "This library supports efficient substring manipulation through slicing, searching, and conversion operations on immutable string views. It works with substrings represented as positional ranges over base strings, enabling zero-copy data processing for tasks like parsing binary formats, extracting fields from structured text, or handling memory-efficient string transformations. Key features include bidirectional conversion to primitive types, overlap detection, and functional transformations that avoid data copying while maintaining compatibility with OCaml's immutable string model.",

      "description": "This module provides a comprehensive suite of immutable set operations for managing collections of strings, including creation, modification (union, intersection, difference), filtering, mapping, and element selection. It works with the `Astring.String.set` type, which ensures ordered storage and efficient membership checks, while supporting conversions to lists, sequences, and standard library sets. Typical use cases involve deduplication, set algebra, and transformations where immutability and persistent data structures are advantageous, such as in functional pipelines or stateless computations.",

It also includes functions to escape and unescape strings using US-ASCII printable representations, supporting both general and OCaml-specific lexical conventions. These operations are useful for ensuring string compatibility with ASCII-based protocols, sanitizing input, or formatting output for display or serialization.",

      "description": "This module offers a comprehensive toolkit for immutable string manipulation, combining core operations like slicing, trimming, and conversion with advanced data organization through sets and maps. It centers around the `string` and `sub` types for direct text handling, while submodules enable ordered key-value associations (`t` maps), efficient substring views, immutable string sets, and ASCII-specific transformations. Users can parse structured data with zero-copy substrings, manage configurations via string-keyed maps, perform set algebra on string collections, and sanitize text with case conversion and escaping utilities. Examples include building text processing pipelines, extracting fields from logs without copying data, and safely handling environment variables with ordered traversal.",

It supports direct manipulation of the `char` type, enabling tasks like parsing binary data, processing ASCII text, and debugging through different character representations. The child module extends this functionality with utilities specific to US-ASCII, such as checking character classes (digits, letters, whitespace), case transformations, and escaping. Together, they allow precise byte-level character processing, validation of ASCII protocols, and safe output of human-readable or machine-parsable character data.",
