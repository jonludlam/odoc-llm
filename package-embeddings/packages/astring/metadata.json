It works directly on `char` values, handling byte ranges specific to US-ASCII. Use it to validate or manipulate ASCII input, such as parsing protocols, sanitizing text, or formatting output.",

It works with ordered string sets implemented as balanced trees, supporting transformations, filtering, and conversions between lists and other set types. These functions are ideal for managing unique string collections, performing efficient membership checks, and handling set algebra in a functional and immutable context.",

It supports precise parsing and modification of string segments through functions like trimming, splitting, searching, and mapping, while maintaining references to the original base string's memory. Typical use cases include efficient text parsing, whitespace-sensitive formatting, and converting substrings to typed values (e.g., integers, floats) without intermediate allocations.",

It provides functions for functional transformations (mapping, filtering, folding), structural inspection (min/max bindings, partitioning), and conversions to/from lists and sequences, with both safe (`find_opt`) and unsafe (`find`) retrieval variants. Typical use cases include managing string-indexed data with ordered key traversal, such as configuration stores, lexicon mappings, or text-processing pipelines requiring efficient, persistent map operations.",

It operates on standard OCaml strings, treating them as sequences of bytes, and ensures compatibility with UTF-8 encoded strings when transforming case. Use cases include sanitizing input for ASCII-only protocols, preparing strings for environments requiring strict ASCII formatting, and handling escaped string representations in configuration or serialization contexts.",

It supports **ASCII character processing**, set/map abstractions for string collections, and numeric conversions for serialization, enabling tasks like parsing, formatting, and safe string traversal without mutation. Designed for functional workflows, it emphasizes efficiency in text processing, data serialization, and immutable collection management under OCaml's `-safe-string` constraints.",

It works with the `char` type, treating it as an 8-bit byte, and includes functions for pretty printing and dumping characters in OCaml syntax. Use it for low-level text processing, protocol parsing, or handling binary data with explicit ASCII constraints.",
