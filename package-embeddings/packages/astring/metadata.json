Operates on individual `char` values and generates strings for escaped representations. Used for validating input, formatting output, and ensuring compatibility with ASCII-based protocols.",

      "description": "The module offers operations for creating, inspecting, and modifying substrings via position-based slicing, filtering, and transformation, working with byte sequences defined by start and stop positions in a base string. It supports tasks like parsing data, text processing, and numeric conversion by enabling prefix/suffix checks, concatenation, and parsing/formatting of substrings into types such as integers or floats. Specific use cases include extracting ranges, validating string patterns, and handling byte-level manipulations with precise positional control.",

It works with ordered string sets, enabling efficient traversal and monotonic predicate-based searches, while supporting transformations like mapping and filtering. Use cases include managing dynamic data collections, safely extracting elements (e.g., max or arbitrary elements), and converting between custom and standard library set representations for interoperability.",
