It includes utilities for parsing/serializing hash values to hexadecimal, safe comparisons, and low-level buffer writes to optimize memory usage. Use cases include secure data integrity verification, authentication protocols, and systems requiring efficient hash processing without intermediate allocations.",

Works with the `status` type, which encapsulates information about tracked data elements. Used to validate data integrity by checking resolved states, generating verification matrices, and querying oracle sources during processing.",

It handles byte-level hashing with `Bytes.t` and `String.t`, integrates Lwt with custom scheduling, enforces thread-safe access with mutexes, and processes status records to extract metadata and verify data integrity. Operations include generating HMACs, wrapping asynchronous computations, acquiring locks with condition waits, and extracting identifiers from status values. This enables secure authentication, scalable concurrency, and reliable data validation in complex systems.",
