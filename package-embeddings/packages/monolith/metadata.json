      "module_path": "Monolith.Support.Iteration",
      "library": "monolith",
      "description": "This module converts various iteration, fold, and indexed iteration functions into element-extraction functions that return lists of values or key-value pairs from collections. It supports operations like transforming `iter`, `foldr`, and `foldl` into functions that collect all elements, and converting `iteri`, `foldri`, and `foldli` into functions that collect indexed elements as pairs. Use this when implementing or testing collection types to extract and compare their contents systematically.",

      "description": "This module provides operations for transforming and consuming sequences with controlled effects, including converting lists to affine sequences, extracting optional heads from sequences, and enforcing single-use constraints on functions and sequences. It works primarily with `Stdlib.Seq.t` and supports values wrapped in `option`. Concrete use cases include managing effectful sequence generators in testing scenarios and ensuring one-time use of resources during specification-based validation.",

      "description": "This module provides functions to convert between flat triples and nested pairs. It works with tuple types, specifically transforming between `'a * 'b * 'c` and `'a * ('b * 'c)` structures. These operations are useful when aligning data representations for compatibility with functions expecting a specific tuple format.",

      "description": "This module provides a single function `handle` that wraps a given function to catch all exceptions, returning a result type that encapsulates either the successful output or the exception. It operates on functions of type `'a -> 'b` and is specifically used to safely execute and capture errors during the testing of candidate implementations against reference implementations. A concrete use case is in test harnesses where unexpected exceptions from untrusted or experimental code must be handled gracefully without aborting the entire test suite.",

It provides `id` for returning values unchanged, `rot2` for swapping the first two arguments of a function, and `rot3` for moving the third argument to the first position. These functions are useful when reshaping function signatures to match expected interfaces, such as adapting functions for higher-order composition or callback systems.",

It supports element extraction from collection folds, safe sequence handling with optional values, tuple restructuring, exception-safe function execution, and argument reordering for function composition. Use it to align data formats, manage effectful iterations, and adapt functions for testing or integration with external interfaces. For example, extract indexed pairs from a custom collection, safely run untrusted code in tests, or reshape a function's arguments for callback compatibility.",

It supports structured data generation for lists, arrays, options, and results, enabling the creation of complex test inputs. Concrete use cases include generating test cases for automated property-based testing and constructing input data for benchmarking or fuzzing.",

It includes document constructors for OCaml expressions like function applications, assertions, and comments, enabling precise code generation and formatting.

It enables testing of nondeterministic behavior, abstract data types, and exception handling through equality overrides, input/output mappings, and type transformations, supporting both random and guided execution. Submodules provide data generation for integers, strings, and structured types; utilities for transforming and adapting functions and collections; and printers for formatting values and OCaml expressions used in test output. Example workflows include generating and validating test cases for a function that processes lists of optional values, reshaping function arguments for compatibility, or safely executing untrusted code during testing.",
