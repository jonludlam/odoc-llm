      "description": "This module provides a function for handling exceptions during the execution of a given function, returning either the result or the exception in a result type. It works with functions of type `'a -> 'b` and values of type `'a`, capturing any exceptions raised during application. A concrete use case is safely executing candidate or reference implementations in test scenarios, where distinguishing between normal and exceptional outcomes is critical.",

      "description": "This module converts iteration and folding functions into element-extraction functions that produce lists of values or key-value pairs. It operates on collections represented through `iter`, `foldr`, `foldl`, `iteri`, `foldri`, and `foldli` functions, returning their elements as lists. Use this to derive enumeration capabilities from existing iteration primitives, particularly when implementing or testing collection-based abstractions like maps or sequences.",

It operates on functions with up to three arguments, enabling argument reordering to facilitate composition and partial application. Concrete use cases include adapting function signatures for pipeline operations and simplifying function currying in test scenarios where argument order affects execution flow.",

It supports data types like `Stdlib.Seq.t` and includes functions to enforce one-shot evaluation, convert sequences to affine variants, and extract optional heads from sequences. Concrete use cases include managing effectful sequences in test scenarios where repeated evaluation must be prevented or inspected.",

It operates on tuples of three elements, restructuring them into nested pairs or flattening them back into triples. These functions are useful when aligning data structures with different arity requirements, such as adapting results from functions that return nested pairs or preparing data for functions expecting flat triples.",

It directly supports testing workflows by enabling precise adaptation of input and output formats, argument reordering, safe execution of potentially failing operations, and deterministic handling of effectful sequences. Concrete use cases include aligning function signatures for test composition, safely evaluating implementations with exception capture, and converting custom iteration logic into enumerable lists for result comparison.",

It supports precise control over value ranges and structures, such as generating integers within specific intervals or selecting elements from a list. Concrete use cases include creating test inputs for automated property-based testing and generating structured data for validating library functions.",

It includes functions to construct OCaml expressions such as function applications, assertions, and comments, with control over layout for pretty-printing. Use this module to generate readable, syntactically correct OCaml code and values, especially when producing test cases or diagnostic output during library testing.",
