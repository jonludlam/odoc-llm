      "description": "Nest3 transforms a three-element tuple into a nested pair structure, while unnest3 reverses this process by expanding nested pairs into a triple. The module operates on tuples of three elements and nested pair structures. It is useful for restructuring data during pattern matching or when preparing inputs for functions expecting specific tuple formats.",

Processes functions that take multiple arguments and returns a transformed version with reordered parameters. Useful for adapting function signatures in higher-order programming scenarios.",

Operates on functions that take a single argument and produce a value, wrapping their execution in a safe context. Used to manage unexpected failures in critical paths, such as parsing user input or processing external data.",

Works with lazy sequences and lists, providing mechanisms to safely extract the first element or convert lists into single-use sequences. Used to enforce single evaluation of potentially expensive computations or to prevent redundant processing in control flow.",

Extracts elements from collections such as maps or lists, returning structured lists for further processing.",

It constructs complex documents by wrapping content in parentheses, applying expressions, adding comments, or embedding in assertion syntax. Handles nested structures and formatting rules for line breaks and indentation.",

Key data types include tuples, nested pairs, lazy sequences, and custom iteration types, with operations like `nest3`, `unnest3`, `reorder`, `safe_call`, `once`, and `collect`. Functions can be adapted for different argument orders, made exception-safe, or converted into single-use forms to control evaluation. Examples include restructuring data for pattern matching, safely parsing input, and extracting elements from maps into lists for downstream processing.",
