It handles private and public key types, offering direct operations to derive public keys from private ones and to compute shared secrets via key scaling. It is used to establish secure cryptographic keys between parties in protocols like TLS and SSH, using hexadecimal string encoding for key serialization and interchange.",

It defines types for private and public keys, along with functions to convert between hexadecimal strings and key types, and to compute public keys from private keys using the curve's base point. Concrete use cases include secure key agreement in cryptographic protocols like TLS and SSH, where two parties generate a shared secret from their respective private and public keys.",
