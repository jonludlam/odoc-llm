It operates on private_key and public_key types, handling hexadecimal string conversions for key serialization and deserialization. Concrete use cases include secure key exchange for cryptographic protocols and generating public keys from private keys without requiring validation of the input.",

It supports key generation from hexadecimal strings, scalar multiplication via the `scale` function, and conversion of keys to and from hex encoding. Concrete use cases include secure key exchange for TLS 1.3 and other cryptographic protocols requiring Diffie-Hellman-like operations with 224-bit security.",

It provides functions to convert between hexadecimal strings and cryptographic keys, perform scalar multiplication, and derive public keys from private keys. It directly supports secure key exchange in cryptographic protocols by handling low-level curve operations on fixed-size byte sequences representing private and public keys.",

It directly supports key derivation and hex encoding operations through types like `private_key` and `public_key`, enabling secure key exchange for protocols like TLS and SSH. The X25519 submodule handles Curve25519-based key exchange and hex conversions, while the X448 submodule provides equivalent functionality using the Ed448-Goldilocks curve with 56-byte keys. Together, they offer low-level, safe cryptographic operations on fixed-size byte sequences without requiring point validation or complex arithmetic.",
