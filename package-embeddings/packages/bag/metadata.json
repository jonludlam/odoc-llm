It supports functional updates, merges (union, sum, intersection), and queries for element counts or presence, while maintaining sorted order through AVL-based structure. The module handles sequences of element-multiplicity pairs for conversion and iteration, making it suitable for applications requiring ordered aggregation, combinatorial operations, or count-aware set manipulations.",

It provides operations to add or remove elements, query counts, and perform set-like operations such as union, intersection, and difference while preserving sorted order. Use cases include tracking item frequencies in a collection, performing combinatorial calculations, and managing ordered aggregates where duplicates are allowed and counted.",
