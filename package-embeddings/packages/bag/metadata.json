It provides functions to add, remove, and merge elements with explicit multiplicity control, along with ordered traversal, comparison, and conversion to/from sequences of element-count pairs. Typical use cases include frequency counting, ordered collection merging with custom conflict resolution, and scenarios requiring deterministic iteration over unique elements with their associated quantities.",

      "description": "This module implements multisets (bags) using an AVL-based ordered map, where each element is associated with its multiplicity. The main operations include adding and removing elements with explicit counts, merging bags with customizable conflict resolution, and comparing or traversing elements in a deterministic order. It supports conversion to and from sequences of element-count pairs, enabling use cases like frequency analysis, ordered aggregation, and deterministic processing of unique elements with their quantities. For example, you can merge two bags by summing multiplicities, or traverse elements in order while accessing each element's count directly.",
