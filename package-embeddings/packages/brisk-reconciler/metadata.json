The JSX-handling submodule translates JSX syntax into standard OCaml constructs by processing attributes and expressions, while the extension-processing submodule detects and transforms custom syntactic constructs like hooks. Together with the attribute transformation submodule, which rewrites annotated expressions and value bindings, it allows implementing rich syntax extensions that control code generation and enforce framework-specific patterns.",
