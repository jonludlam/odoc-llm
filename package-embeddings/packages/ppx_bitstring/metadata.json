It provides constructors and pattern matching support for building and deconstructing bitstring values in a type-safe manner. Concrete use cases include parsing and constructing binary data formats, such as network protocols or file formats, where precise bit-level control is required.",

It supports precise construction and deconstruction of bitstrings through data types like `t` for bitstring values, records for qualifiers, and enumerated types for endianness and sign, all tied to OCaml's Parsetree for expression and pattern handling. Operations include initializing and advancing parsing contexts, specifying field qualifiers with type and endianness, and modeling match fields with patterns and lengths. Examples include parsing network protocols with custom endianness, extracting signed integer fields from a bitstring, and generating efficient bit-level serialization code with offset tracking.",
