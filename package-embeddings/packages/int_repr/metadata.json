Use this module when serializing integers into a buffer or memory-mapped structure with precise control over representation and alignment.",

It supports low-level manipulation of integer representations in byte buffers and strings with configurable endianness, enabling precise control over memory layout and numeric behavior. These capabilities are particularly useful for implementing binary protocols, serialization formats, and robust numerical systems requiring overflow handling and cross-platform consistency.",
