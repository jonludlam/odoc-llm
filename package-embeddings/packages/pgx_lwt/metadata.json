It works with the `Io.t` monad, which wraps Lwt promises, and includes functions like `return`, bind (`>>=`), exception catching, and resource protection. Concrete use cases include writing non-blocking database clients, managing network connections, and safely handling exceptions in asynchronous workflows.",

It supports operations for preparing, executing, describing, and closing statements, along with variants for mapping, folding, and iterating over results. Use cases include efficiently running parameterized queries, handling side-effecting database operations, and inspecting result metadata without re-parsing queries.",

It provides core functionality for reading query parameters, writing result sets, and handling communication over network sockets, working with types like channels and `sockaddr`. Its child module implements low-level network I/O, enabling direct socket communication, binary data transfer, and connection management.

It integrates an I/O submodule based on the `Io.t` monad for non-blocking communication, resource safety, and exception handling, alongside a prepared statement submodule that enables efficient, reusable SQL execution with parameter binding and result iteration. Together, these components support tasks like safely managing transactions, sending parameterized queries, and handling asynchronous result streams with minimal overhead. Example workflows include executing a prepared statement inside a transaction block while managing connection lifecycle and error recovery through the I/O layer.",
