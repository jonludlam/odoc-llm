It supports operations like parameterized query execution, result folding and mapping, portal management, and statement description, working with parameterized SQL queries and typed result sets. Concrete use cases include safely executing user-provided queries with bound parameters, iterating over large result sets, and managing server-side prepared statements with explicit resource cleanup.",

It works with the `ssl_config` type for configuring SSL connections and the `Io.t` monad for sequencing I/O actions. Concrete use cases include writing non-blocking network clients with SSL support, handling exceptions during I/O operations, and ensuring cleanup code runs after operations complete.",

It works with SSL configurations, database connections, and parameterized SQL queries to enable non-blocking database access with proper resource handling. Concrete use cases include building Lwt-based network services that require reliable PostgreSQL interaction with automatic connection cleanup, transactional safety, and efficient batch query execution.",
