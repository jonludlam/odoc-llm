Works with OCaml AST structures and type representations to automate boilerplate generation.

It supports deriving Irmin type representations and their signatures, working directly with `Ppxlib` structures and type declarations. Concrete use cases include generating serialization logic and schema definitions for Irmin-based data types.",

It operates on OCaml AST types such as `Ppxlib.expression`, `core_type`, `rec_flag`, and `type_declaration`. It is used in the implementation of derivers that generate type representations for Irmin, handling both structure and signature generation with optional plugin extensions and library names.",

It provides operations for transforming OCaml AST structures and type representations to derive serializers, pretty-printers, and similar utilities directly from types. Key data types include AST nodes and type descriptors, manipulated through functions that map types to generated code. For example, it can automatically derive a JSON serializer for a user-defined variant type or generate introspection functions for data structures.",

It provides core functionality for parsing and expanding type representations in PPX rewriters, handling expressions, core types, and type declarations, with support for Irmin-based data types and custom deriving plugins. The child modules extend this by processing structure and signature items, managing library arguments, and generating type representations with optional plugin extensions. Examples include deriving Irmin type representations, inspecting type structures at compile time, and generating boilerplate code for records and variants.",

It supports the creation of serializers, deserializers, and other type-specific functions directly from OCaml type definitions. The Plugins submodule extends this capability by implementing specialized generic operations over representable types, generating code from `Ppxlib` structures and core types. Together, they enable automatic derivation of functions like equality, serialization, and traversal through type representations rather than AST manipulation.",
