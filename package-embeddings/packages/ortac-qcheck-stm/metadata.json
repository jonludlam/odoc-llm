It includes operations to construct and manipulate terms with associated source text, project values with type information, and specify preconditions, postconditions, and state modifications for functions. These structures are used to represent the behavior of system-under-test components and their interactions with ghost state in property-based testing scenarios.",

It handles operations like type unification, argument splitting, and state transition extraction, working with data types such as `val_description`, `signature_item`, and `core_type`. Concrete use cases include extracting preconditions, postconditions, and state transitions from function specifications to drive property-based testing scenarios.",

It provides operations for term substitution, state manipulation, and the generation of expressions, patterns, and structure items from IR elements like types, identifiers, and values, with support for error handling and configuration. These utilities are specifically used to produce QCheck-based test generators, command serializers, and model modules that validate state machine behavior during property-based testing.",

It processes PPX AST fragments to build a validated configuration record, handling type definitions, value bindings, and module structures. Key operations include scanning declarations, validating SUT (System Under Test) types, and initializing configurations with context and module prefixes.",

It provides the `cmd` value, which represents a command that can be executed via the command line to run property-based tests. It is used to enable testing workflows directly through executable commands, specifically for state machine models tested with QCheck.",

It introduces a `reserr` type representing fallible computations alongside error and warning variants for specific failure modes like function arity mismatches, type inconsistencies, or missing specifications, with support for traversing lists and promoting warnings to errors. Its applicative operations (`<$>`, `<*>`) and formatter enable structured error accumulation and reporting, making it suitable for validation pipelines, configuration processing, or any context requiring robust error tracking with human-readable diagnostics.",

It operates on abstract syntax trees and intermediate representations derived from Gospel specifications, enabling use cases such as test case generation, state machine validation, and integration of formal verification into build pipelines. Main data types include terms, values, state transitions, and configurations, with core operations spanning parsing, transformation, code generation, and error handling. Submodules support model construction, type processing, OCaml AST translation, configuration management, CLI integration, and structured error propagation for robust test model development.",
