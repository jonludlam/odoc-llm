It includes operations to construct and manipulate terms with associated source text, project values with type information, and manage preconditions, postconditions, and state transitions. Concrete use cases involve modeling function specifications, tracking state changes, and encoding testable properties with explicit location and type information.",

It handles operations like type unification, argument splitting, and state invariant extraction, working with data types such as `val_description`, `signature_item`, and `core_type`. Concrete use cases include extracting initial state definitions, postconditions, and next-state transitions from Gospel specifications to drive property-based testing workflows.",

It provides the `cmd` value, which represents a command that can be executed to run property tests. The module works with QCheck properties and test configurations, enabling developers to validate invariants and edge cases in data processing pipelines or stateful computations.",

It offers applicative operations (`fmap`, `<*>`) and pretty-printing for the `reserr` type, which encapsulates error-aware computations, enabling robust composition and traversal of fallible operations. Key use cases include sequencing error-propagating computations, converting between optional and result-based values, and managing warnings in test generation workflows.",

It operates on OCaml abstract syntax trees (ASTs) using types like `core_type`, `expression`, and `structure` from `Ppxlib`, along with context and error-handling types from other modules. It supports concrete tasks like extracting SUT (System Under Test) type names, validating type parameters, building configurations from module bindings, and scanning user-provided configuration strings to populate test generation settings.",

It processes OCaml AST nodes to extract test models, constructs intermediate representations with state transitions and invariants, and generates test configurations with validation rules. Key operations include parsing user-defined models, building stateful test generators, and executing property checks against system-under-test implementations.",
