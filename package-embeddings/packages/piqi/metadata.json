      "description": "This module offers a comprehensive toolkit for list manipulation, encompassing element access, construction, concatenation, transformation, filtering, folding, sorting, and searching operations on generic `'a list` values. It integrates custom transformation and comparison functions, supporting both structural and physical equality checks, while providing tail-recursive implementations for performance-critical tasks and safety-focused utilities like optional element retrieval. These capabilities are tailored for data processing pipelines, algorithm implementation, and scenarios requiring efficient list handling with customizable behavior, including sequence conversion through iterative mapping.",

It supports operations like reading the next byte, extracting a block of bytes, converting the buffer to a string, and tracking the current position and size. Concrete use cases include parsing binary data from files or network streams and managing incremental input consumption during protocol decoding.",

      "description": "This module provides low-level parsing and serialization for binary data, particularly for Protocol Buffers wire format, using input and output buffers to handle numeric types, strings, and structured data. It enables deserialization of binary messages into OCaml values, processing of repeated fields and packed arrays, and efficient encoding with zigzag or fixed-size representations. The bundled list module supports transformation, filtering, and folding operations for data processing pipelines, while the input buffer submodule manages incremental consumption of binary data from strings or channels. The output buffer module builds binary or text payloads by concatenating strings and structures, supporting dynamic size calculation and direct serialization to channels.",
