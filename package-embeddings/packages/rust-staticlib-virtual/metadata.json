It handles the compilation, linking, and embedding of Rust code, allowing OCaml programs to leverage Rust's performance and safety. Key data types include compiled library artifacts and build configuration structures, with operations for linking and embedding. Users can compile Rust code once and dynamically incorporate it into OCaml applications for system-level tasks.",
