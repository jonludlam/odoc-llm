It operates on structured data types like connections, commands, results, and custom SQL type representations, enabling precise control over database interactions. These capabilities are useful for applications requiring efficient data retrieval, type conversion, and structured database modeling.",

It supports sequential query workflows and direct interaction with database servers, making it suitable for scenarios requiring precise control over query execution or integration with FreeTDS-based systems. Specific use cases include handling complex SQL transactions, custom result processing, and environments where direct C API compatibility is necessary.",
