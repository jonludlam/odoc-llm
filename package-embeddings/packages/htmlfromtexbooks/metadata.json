It works with strings and hash tables to store and manipulate glossary terms and definitions. Concrete use cases include converting textbook glossary files into HTML output and extracting term-definition pairs from formatted input.",

      "description": "This module parses LaTeX documents into an abstract syntax tree (AST) composed of commands and structures such as chapters, sections, environments, and math expressions. It processes raw strings by identifying LaTeX commands (e.g., `\\chapter`, `\\fracx`), extracting arguments, and organizing content into nested structures like `Env`, `OneArgCmd`, and `Subsubsection`. Concrete use cases include transforming LaTeX source into structured data for HTML rendering or analyzing document layout for automated conversion.",

It transforms structured data like expressions and environments (e.g., align, equation) into valid LaTeX strings suitable for web rendering. Use cases include converting internal AST representations of math content into displayable LaTeX for HTML output and recalculating environment indices to ensure correct numbering and alignment in rendered equations.",

It works with basic data types such as strings, character lists, and file paths. Concrete use cases include parsing text files, processing string data, and handling file input/output operations.",
