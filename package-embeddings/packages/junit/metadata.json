It enables low-level manipulation of JUnit test result data, mapping internal representations to XML formats for reporting or integration with testing frameworks.

Supports creating test cases with status, duration, and messages, along with adding key-value properties and organizing them into test suites with contextual attributes. Enables generating detailed JUnit-compatible output by aggregating individual test outcomes and associated configuration. For example, it can track a test's execution time, log environment variables, and compile all results into a single suite for reporting.",
