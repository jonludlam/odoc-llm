It works with polymorphic vectors supporting read and write operations, with optional results for safe indexing. Concrete use cases include transforming vector elements with flipped map operators, combining vectors through Cartesian products, and chaining operations with monadic bind syntax.",

It includes operations for indexing, insertion, removal, sorting, mapping, filtering, folding, zipping, and structural comparisons, enabling tasks like algorithmic data processing and handling sequences with varying access constraints. The child module adds infix operators for indexed access, mapping, flattening, appending, and Cartesian product construction, supporting concise expression chains and monadic-style vector transformations. Together, they allow both imperative modifications and functional composition on vector data.",
