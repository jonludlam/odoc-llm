It uses a finalizer to detect key expiration and requires explicit calls to `reclaim_space_for_keys_with_unused_data` to free memory, distinguishing itself from OCaml's `Weak.Make`, which behaves more like a weak set. The `Using_hashable` submodule allows custom hashable types to define key comparison and hashing, enabling use cases like caching intermediate results keyed by ephemeral values or managing resources that should be automatically cleaned up when no longer in use. For example, it can memoize functions over large data structures without preventing garbage collection or track object identities in a resource manager.",
