Key types include `t` for limiter state, `result` for error handling, and `sexp` for serialization, with operations to acquire, return, and check tokens, as well as manage job slots. Functions like `try_take_token`, `try_start_job`, and `serialize` enable precise control over resource usage in systems like API rate limiting or message processing. Examples include validating user access based on token availability or restricting simultaneous task execution with both rate and concurrency limits.",
