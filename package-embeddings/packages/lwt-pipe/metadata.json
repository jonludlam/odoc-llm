It supports mapping values through a function before writing, and sending data to multiple pipes either pairwise or across a list. These operations are useful for broadcasting log messages to multiple outputs or preprocessing data streams before writing them to different destinations.",

It handles asynchronous streams of values, supporting both synchronous and Lwt-based functions. Use cases include processing log entries, aggregating results from multiple asynchronous sources, and transforming data streams in event-driven applications.",

It provides functions to read from input channels into a pipe reader, either by lines or with a specified buffer size, and to write from a pipe writer to an output channel, either line-by-line or as raw data. Use cases include streaming network data asynchronously or processing input/output through pipelines without blocking.",

It bridges pipes with data structures such as strings, lists, and buffers, offering utilities to transform streams into aggregated values or split data with separators. Commonly used for non-blocking I/O workflows, it integrates with Lwt_io to handle tasks like network data processing or streaming transformations in concurrent applications.",
