Writes strings to an output channel, with an additional variant for writing lines. Operates on Lwt_io input and output channels, enabling asynchronous I/O operations. Used for processing large files line by line or streaming data efficiently.",

It supports reading and writing strings with customizable buffering, applies transformations like mapping and filtering, and allows data to be sent to multiple destinations. Operations include reading lines from files, writing to multiple outputs, and processing event streams. Examples include logging to both console and file, streaming data over networks, and aggregating multiple input sources.",
