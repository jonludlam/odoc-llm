It handles asynchronous streams of values, allowing for sequential processing, filtering, and merging of multiple streams. Concrete use cases include processing event streams, transforming asynchronous data flows, and aggregating results from multiple sources.",

It works with Lwt_pipe.pipe values, specifically those supporting write operations.

It provides functions to read from input channels into pipes either as raw strings or line-by-line, and to write strings from pipes to output channels, also with line-based support. Use it to integrate streaming IO with producer-consumer pipelines, such as processing lines from a network socket or feeding data from a file into a processing pipeline.",

      "description": "This module enables asynchronous bidirectional communication through pipes that support reading, writing, and connection management with configurable blocking. It handles data as streams, buffers, strings, and lists, allowing efficient transformations between streamed and aggregated forms for continuous processing. The core operations facilitate creating and managing pipes, while submodules extend functionality for stream transformation, broadcast, and integration with IO channels. For example, you can map and fold over asynchronous value streams, broadcast writes across multiple pipes, or connect network sockets to processing pipelines line-by-line.",
