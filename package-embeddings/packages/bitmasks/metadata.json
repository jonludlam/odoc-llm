      "description": "This module implements a set interface using bitmasks, supporting standard operations like union, intersection, difference, and membership tests, along with comparisons and quantifiers. It operates on elements represented as bits within a storage type, ordered by their bit significance, where each bit encodes the presence of a distinct element. It is particularly suited for managing compact sets of flags, permissions, or enumerated states where individual elements map directly to bit positions.",

It works with `Mask.storage` for compact bitmask representation and `Mask.t` for individual bit values, enabling functional traversal, filtering, and folding over bit positions in ascending or descending order.
