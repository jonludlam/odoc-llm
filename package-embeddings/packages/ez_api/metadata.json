      "description": "This module defines core data types and error variants for user authentication and session management, including structured representations for login messages, authentication challenges, and detailed error conditions. It enforces correct handling of session states and authentication flows in networked applications, with support for both local and foreign login mechanisms. The child module extends this functionality by defining session parameters, user identity types, and token storage mechanisms such as cookies and CSRF headers, along with their JSON encodings. Together, they enable concrete use cases like configuring authentication workflows (login, logout, CSRF protection) and managing session behavior in API servers.",

It structures input, output, and error handling through service definitions and integrates with JSON encodings for serialization of authentication states, user info, and error conditions like invalid credentials or session expiration. Developers can use it to secure API endpoints, manage session tokens, and enforce CSRF protection while ensuring type-safe interactions across authentication workflows. The combination of service definitions and encodings enables building robust, secure web authentication systems with consistent data handling and error reporting.",
