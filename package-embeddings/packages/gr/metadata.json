      "description": "This module manages graphical workstations and rendering contexts, supporting operations like opening, closing, activating, and clearing workstations. It works with a variety of output types including raster formats (BMP, JPEG, PNG), vector formats (PDF, SVG, PostScript), display systems (X11, Windows GDI, Gtk, Qt), and network protocols (Socket, ZeroMQ). Use cases include rendering graphics to files, displaying interactive visualizations on screen, and streaming graphical output over a network.",

It supports scientific visualization workflows through low-level control of display attributes, 2D/3D plotting of data arrays, and pixel-accurate rendering tasks like text layout and image compositing. The interface enables high-performance state management for interactive applications, handling operations from polyline drawing to Delaunay triangulation via direct C bindings.",

It provides functions to open and close graphics files, retrieve and draw graphics data, and import graphics from external files. It works with a `t` type representing graphics state and uses integers to reference imported or drawn graphics elements. Use it to generate or manipulate graphical output directly, such as rendering shapes or embedding images in a graphics context.",

It works with strings for file paths, polymorphic variants for print modes, paper formats, and orientations. Concrete use cases include initiating print jobs with precise formatting, such as printing a document in landscape orientation on A4 paper or generating grayscale reports on legal-sized paper.",

      "description": "This module orchestrates graphical rendering and interaction by integrating configuration of visual attributes, coordinate systems, and primitive drawing with support for workstations, user input, and state management. It operates on numerical data in Bigarrays and abstract coordinate spaces, offering core operations like polyline and polygon rendering, LaTeX text layout, and 2D/3D surface plotting, while submodules handle output destinations (files, displays, network), user-driven region manipulation, and transactional state handling. Use it to build scientific visualizations with interactive controls, generate publication-quality plots with mathematical annotations, or manage rendering state for dynamic, high-performance graphics. Specific capabilities include rendering to PDF or OpenGL contexts, implementing drag-and-resize canvas interactions, and rolling back graphical state changes during speculative rendering passes.",
