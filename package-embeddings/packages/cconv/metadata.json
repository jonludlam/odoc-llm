      "description": "The module offers encoding operations for basic types (e.g., booleans, integers, floats, strings) and structured data (lists, options, arrays, tuples, records), employing type-specific encoders and compositional higher-order functions. It supports tuple construction (triple, quad) and sum type encoding (sum, sum0, sum_fix), enabling precise control over structured data representation. This is particularly useful for serialization tasks, data transformation workflows, or preparing complex data for specific output formats.",

      "description": "The module provides decoding operations for primitive types, collections, and structured data, including records, sums, tuples, and nested constructs, using pattern-based strategies to map serialized formats to OCaml values. It works with source data such as lists, arrays, strings, and tuples, enabling extraction of complex types like options and multi-argument tuples. This supports use cases like parsing JSON or B-encode structures, transforming serialized inputs into typed OCaml representations with precise argument handling.",

It handles tuples, options, sums, records, and nested structures, allowing precise control over encoding and decoding processes.

Examples include serializing a record with optional fields or decoding a nested list of tuples into a structured OCaml type.",
