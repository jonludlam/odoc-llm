Works with a type constructor that wraps values of any type. Used to manage side effects and propagate errors in a controlled manner during asynchronous or conditional workflows.",

Supports lifting values into the monad, composing operations, and recovering from errors during execution. Allows for structured management of side effects in asynchronous or conditional code paths. For example, it can chain HTTP request handlers that fail gracefully or transform results while maintaining error context.",

It supports lifting values into the monad, chaining asynchronous or conditional operations, and preserving error context through transformations. This allows for building robust HTTP request pipelines that handle failures gracefully and maintain result integrity. For instance, it can sequence multiple API calls, transform responses, and recover from network errors without crashing.",
