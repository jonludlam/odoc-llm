      "description": "Encodes and decodes strings using Base64 transformation, converting between binary data and ASCII strings. It handles raw byte sequences represented as strings and produces encoded or decoded string outputs. This is used for safely transmitting binary content over text-based protocols or storing it in systems that expect ASCII input.",

Works with a recursive type representing JSON values, including objects as lists of key-value pairs. Enables direct access to fields, conversion to native OCaml types, and error handling for invalid casts.",

Works with lazy lists of any type, supporting functions like `take` to extract a fixed number of elements and `repeat` to generate infinite sequences. Used for processing large or infinite data streams, such as reading from a file incrementally or generating continuous input for simulations.",

It enables execution of parsers across diverse input sources like files, standard input, and custom functions, managing parser states and error types consistently. This supports use cases such as analyzing textual data, interpreting user input, and integrating with external data pipelines through adaptable parsing workflows.",
