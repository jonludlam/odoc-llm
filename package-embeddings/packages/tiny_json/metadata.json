It provides the `encode` function to convert a raw string into its Base64 representation and `decode` to convert a Base64 string back to its original form. These functions are useful for handling binary data in text-based formats, such as embedding images in JSON or transmitting data over text protocols.",

It supports parsing from strings or input channels, extracting fields from JSON objects, and coercing values to specific types like strings, numbers, or booleans, with appropriate error handling. Use cases include reading configuration files, processing API responses, and validating JSON data structures directly in OCaml code.",

It provides JSON values, lazy lists, and string conversion functions as core data types, with operations for parsing, transforming, and encoding data. You can decode UTF-16 input to UTF-8, encode binary data in Base64, build and query JSON structures, and process streams of data lazily. Examples include parsing a JSON API response, embedding an image in Base64 within a JSON payload, or reading a large UTF-16 encoded file incrementally.",
