It provides the `encode` function to convert a raw string into its Base64 representation and `decode` to convert a Base64 string back to its original form. These functions are useful for handling binary data in text-based formats, such as embedding images in JSON or transmitting credentials in HTTP headers.",

It works with functions, lazy values, lists, and strings, offering direct operations like formatting, hex conversion, and file input handling. Concrete use cases include composing transformation pipelines, forcing lazy evaluations, generating string representations of lists, and reading files with guaranteed resource cleanup.",

It operates on character streams and state types, supporting error tracking and input position management. The module enables parsing JSON data from strings, files, or custom input sources, making it suitable for building robust JSON parsers with precise error reporting and flexible input handling.",

It supports core list-like functionality such as `hd`, `tl`, `map`, `filter`, and `take`, while enabling construction of lists from streams, functions, or strings. Use cases include parsing large JSON inputs incrementally, generating infinite sequences with `repeat` or `continually`, and efficiently combining or transforming data streams without full traversal.",
