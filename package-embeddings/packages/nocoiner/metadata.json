Operates on binary data and cryptographic keys, with support for fixed-size output digests. Used to implement secure coin flipping protocols where parties commit to a value without revealing it, then later reveal it to verify authenticity.",

      "description": "provides a framework for implementing commitment schemes used in coin flipping protocols, focusing on cryptographic integrity and fairness. It includes data types for commitments, openings, and random values, along with operations to create, verify, and reveal commitments. Users can generate secure commitments, validate them against provided openings, and ensure tamper resistance in distributed agreement scenarios. Example use cases include secure multi-party coin tosses and verifiable random number generation.",
