It works with `Unix.file_descr` and structured stream types like `Iostream.In.t_seekable` and `Iostream.Out.t_seekable`, enabling precise control over file or socket positioning. You can use it to read binary data from a file at a specific offset, send raw bytes over a network socket, or implement custom protocols requiring exact stream positioning.",

It supports creating, resizing, and accessing sub-ranges, along with advancing the offset for sequential data processing such as parsing binary streams or handling network packets. The design enables direct and efficient operations on specific buffer regions without copying. For example, it can track current position in a buffer while parsing a binary protocol or manage variable-length network packet payloads.",
