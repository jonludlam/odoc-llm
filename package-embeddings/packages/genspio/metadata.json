It includes functions for handling literal values with proper escaping, managing file descriptor redirections, and composing executable command sequences with control flow. Concrete use cases include generating safe shell scripts from OCaml code, embedding environment interactions, and structuring complex command pipelines with typed guarantees.",

It works with shell values like strings, integers, booleans, and files, supporting advanced scripting patterns such as process piping, I/O redirection, and dynamic command building. Use cases include creating self-documenting scripts, command dispatchers, and robust shell workflows with error handling, temporary file management, and structured control flow.",
