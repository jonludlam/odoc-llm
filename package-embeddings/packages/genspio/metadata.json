      "description": "This module translates high-level command specifications into executable shell scripts, combining octal encoding, variable expansion, and signal handling with the ability to compose structured shell logic through a domain-specific language. It introduces core types like `command` and `t` to represent script fragments, supporting operations such as conditional branching, redirection, and sub-shell execution, while also managing temporary files through registration, tracking, and cleanup mechanisms. With it, users can generate deployment scripts, automate system tasks with dynamic content, and ensure safe handling of temporary resources in complex automation pipelines. The integration of control flow constructs and temporary file management enables robust, composable shell script generation tailored for system administration and automated workflows.",

      "description": "This module compiles Genspio expressions into POSIX shell scripts, offering both single-line and multi-line output formats, with support for failure handling and direct execution. It produces `Script.t` values that represent serialized command sequences, enabling the generation of portable shell scripts for cross-platform deployment or reliable execution in restricted environments. The `Script` submodule provides an abstract syntax tree for constructing and pretty-printing shell logic, allowing programmatic creation of complex scripts such as installers or deployment hooks. Example uses include generating shell commands from high-level EDSL expressions, converting control flow into POSIX-compatible code, and executing compiled scripts directly via system calls.",

It supports expressions over commands, strings, integers, and file descriptors, with operations for logic, arithmetic, string comparison, and list manipulation, including dynamic command assembly and structured output parsing. Child modules extend functionality with command-line parsing, subcommand dispatch, self-documenting scripts, and typed list and boolean conversions, while unsafe operations allow embedding raw shell code when needed. Examples include generating scripts with conditionals and loops, building CLIs with typed argument parsing, and dynamically routing subcommands based on input arguments.",
