It works with `char` values and `Coin.encoding` to determine valid scalar representation, equality, and Unicode conversion. Concrete use cases include validating character inputs, comparing characters for sorting, and decoding characters into their Unicode representation.",

It tracks decoding progress across partial inputs and handles malformed sequences, making it suitable for streaming or incremental text processing. The child module for character validation and decoding checks scalar values, compares characters, and decodes them into Unicode, enabling tasks like input validation and text normalization. Another child module folds over encoded characters in a string, processing each character and its position to support custom parsing and transformation workflows.",
