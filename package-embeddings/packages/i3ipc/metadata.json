It works with maps where keys are of type `colorable_bar_part`, enabling efficient iteration, transformation, and conversion between maps and sequences. Use cases include managing configuration data or hierarchical structures requiring ordered access and predicate-based filtering.",

It enables structured data manipulation through construction, modification, and querying operations. Users can filter data using predicates, convert maps to sequences, and manage hierarchical or configuration data. For example, it allows building a map of colored bar segments and extracting only those with a specific attribute.",

It works with custom types representing system or user-triggered actions, including bar configurations and shutdown reasons, tailored for a tiling window manager. Use cases include debugging event flows, logging user interactions, and monitoring dynamic configuration changes in real-time.",
