It provides functions to transform, filter, and convert maps via sequences, primarily used for managing status bar configurations or state data in i3 window manager integrations.",

It operates on type-specific event representations with embedded data such as node hierarchies, binding identifiers, and event timestamps. Use cases include monitoring i3 session activity for dynamic UI updates, logging event streams with contextual details, or debugging environment state changes through human-readable event summaries.",

      "description": "This module provides utilities for parsing and representing structured responses from the i3 window manager's IPC protocol, focusing on window geometries, layout hierarchies, and configuration states. It operates on typed data structures like rectangles, color schemes, and bar part mappings to model window manager properties such as workspaces, outputs, and binding modes. The pretty-printing functions aid in debugging and visualizing hierarchical layout data or configuration values during dynamic window management tasks.",

It operates on typed representations of IPC connections, events, and replies, supporting use cases like automating window management workflows, building dynamic status bars, or synchronizing external tools with i3's runtime state. Specific functions allow sending custom IPC messages and handling real-time notifications for tasks such as workspace monitoring or layout adjustments.",
