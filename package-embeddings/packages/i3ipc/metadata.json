      "description": "This module implements an ordered map structure for managing associations between `colorable_bar_part` keys and arbitrary values, emphasizing ordered traversal, list-valued transformations, and predicate-based queries. It supports functional updates, set-theoretic operations, and sequence conversions, with specialized handling for list-structured values and ordered key ranges. Designed for scenarios like dynamic UI configuration in window managers, it enables efficient manipulation of colorable status bar components with ordered persistence and bulk transformations.",

      "description": "This module processes i3 window manager IPC responses into structured data models that represent window properties, layout hierarchies, and bar configurations, with utilities to parse, render, and debug them. It includes an ordered map submodule for managing colorable bar parts, supporting efficient lookups, ordered traversal, and list-valued transformations. Main data types include workspaces, outputs, layout nodes, and color schemes, with operations for querying window state, modifying bar configurations, and generating human-readable layouts. Example uses include extracting active workspace geometry, transforming status bar colors dynamically, and printing hierarchical window structures for debugging.",

It defines structured representations for event-specific data like node states, binding triggers, and output configurations, alongside utility functions to convert these into human-readable strings. These capabilities are particularly useful for monitoring dynamic changes in i3 environments, such as automating layout adjustments or logging user interactions triggered by keybindings or workspace switches.",

It supports structured response handling through the `Reply` submodule, which models window properties and bar configurations, and the `Event` submodule, which processes and formats events like workspace transitions and binding activations. Operations include querying active workspace geometry, modifying bar color schemes, and subscribing to window focus changes or configuration updates.
