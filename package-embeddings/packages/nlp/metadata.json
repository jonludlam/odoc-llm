It works with ordered maps and sequences, enabling tasks like filtering, folding, and converting between map and list representations. Use cases include processing structured data, managing configurations, or building dynamic mappings from sequential inputs.",

It handles sequences and ordered structures, enabling filtering, folding, and dynamic data construction. Users can manipulate structured data, adjust configurations, or build mappings from input streams. Examples include merging multiple configuration maps or extracting specific entries from a large dataset.",
