It operates on immutable key-value collections parameterized by arbitrary value types, with keys adhering to a specific token-based ordering. Typical applications include processing linguistic token sequences, maintaining frequency counts, and implementing ordered dictionary operations where key ranges or ordered iteration are critical.",

      "description": "This module processes text data through tokenization, vectorization, and similarity computation, working with strings and integer-based token representations to support operations like converting text into tokens, transforming token sequences into vectors, and calculating cosine similarity between vectors. It includes a submodule that implements ordered map abstractions over token keys, enabling atomic updates, bulk transformations, and ordered traversal over immutable key-value collections, which is useful for maintaining frequency counts and processing linguistic token sequences. Together, they support tasks like comparing document similarity, building text classification pipelines, or managing ordered dictionaries with token-based keys. The combined interface allows end-to-end workflows from raw text to structured analysis using both direct operations and ordered token mappings.",
