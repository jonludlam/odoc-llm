It supports tagged unions for dynamic data, filesystem operations, sparse matrix processing, and numerical computations, with functions to convert between Python and OCaml types, manage paths, handle warnings, and perform statistical operations. Examples include converting Python dictionaries to OCaml records, resolving file paths, computing class weights, and generating MurmurHash digests. It enables efficient data processing, numerical stability, and integration of Python libraries within OCaml workflows.",
