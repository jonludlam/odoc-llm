It enables non-blocking read and write operations, secure connection establishment, and flexible network setup. Users can manage TLS client settings, route data over encrypted channels, and integrate with event-driven architectures. Examples include establishing secure chat connections, streaming data over TLS, and configuring custom network policies.",
