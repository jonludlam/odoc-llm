Operates on immutable data structures optimized for fast access, with a focus on hash-based keys for use in version control systems. Designed for scenarios requiring rapid key-based retrieval, such as accessing objects in a distributed file system or content-addressable storage.",

It enables ordered key manipulation, such as finding extrema or splitting the tree, and transforms values through mapping and folding, making it suitable for applications like routing tables or autocomplete systems requiring hierarchical key structures.",
