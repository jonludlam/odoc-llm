      "library": "dose3.versioning",
      "description": "This module handles version parsing, comparison, and manipulation across multiple versioning schemes, including semantic versioning and Debian-specific formats. It provides data types for structured versions, such as semantic versions with major/minor/patch components and Debian versions with epoch, upstream, and revision parts. Operations include version comparison, equivalence checking, decomposition, and validation against supported formats. Examples include resolving package dependencies, validating version constraints, sorting package versions, and extracting version components for system compatibility checks.",
