It works with SSL sockets, Unix addresses, and standard and bigarray buffers for efficient data handling. Concrete use cases include implementing secure client-server communication where non-blocking behavior and precise SSL control are required, such as in custom TLS-based protocols or high-performance secure network services.",

It supports operations on SSL contexts and sockets, enabling server and client authentication, trust store setup, and secure data transmission. The error-handling submodule inspects SSL error codes and messages for debugging failed connections, while the socket submodule enables low-level, non-blocking SSL socket operations with Unix addresses and efficient buffer types. Example uses include implementing custom TLS protocols, diagnosing handshake failures, and building high-performance secure network services.",
