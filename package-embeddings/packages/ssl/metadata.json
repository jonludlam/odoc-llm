Works with socket descriptors and byte buffers, supporting non-blocking I/O and direct buffer manipulation. Used for secure communication in multi-threaded environments where SSL operations must not interleave.",

Offers access to error codes, library names, and reason strings for debugging, and supports buffer-based data transfer with socket descriptors. Enables thread-safe SSL operations by avoiding the OCaml runtime lock during I/O. Can be used to inspect failure reasons after a cryptographic operation or to implement high-performance secure servers.",
