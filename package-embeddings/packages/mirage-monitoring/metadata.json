It supports runtime configuration of log levels and metrics sources through a TCP listener, and provides memory profiling via a dedicated TCP port for Gc.Memprof traces. It operates on network addresses, TCP connections, and runtime metrics, with configurable sampling rates and ports for different functionalities.",

      "description": "This module enables monitoring of virtual machines by defining metrics sources with dynamic tagging, supporting counter metrics and tagging with VM names. It allows tracking of performance data like CPU and memory usage in MirageOS unikernels, while integrating initialization logic that sends metrics over TCP to an InfluxDB endpoint, configurable at runtime. Submodule functionality extends this by enabling network-based metric collection, log level adjustments, and memory profiling through dedicated TCP ports. Specific capabilities include tagging metrics with dynamic fields, setting sampling intervals, and streaming GC memory traces for analysis.",
