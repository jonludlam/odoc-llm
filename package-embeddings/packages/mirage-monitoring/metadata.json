It works with network flows, IP addresses, ports, and a type `t` representing connection states, supporting buffered or nodelay writes and error recovery. Use cases include building reliable network applications, managing bidirectional data streams, and ensuring controlled connection termination.",

Handles IP layer operations such as demultiplexing incoming packets, sending data with configurable fragmentation and TTL, and generating pseudoheaders for checksums. Works with IP addresses, prefixes, and network interfaces, supporting use cases like packet inspection, custom IP routing, and network diagnostics.",
