It supports topological sorting, parallel execution planning, and DOT visualization, enabling tasks such as scheduling package builds, grouping independent actions, and generating visual dependency graphs. Key data types include vertices with labels and actions, directed edges with dependency metadata, and sets and maps for managing and transforming action collections. Specific capabilities include serializing action graphs to JSON, executing actions concurrently with resource limits, and performing set-theoretic operations to analyze and manipulate dependency structures.",
