It introduces a `split` function to create independent random streams, enabling parallel or isolated generation workflows. The module works with random state objects to ensure reproducible sequences of values, particularly useful for compatibility with OCaml versions prior to 5.0 and scenarios requiring explicit control over random number generation in property-based testing.",
