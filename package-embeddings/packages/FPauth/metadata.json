It centers around authentication workflows using strategies conforming to `Auth_sign.STRATEGY`, with core data types including user entities, session data, authentication flags, and local state variables. Operations include per-request authentication checks, session-based user tracking, login/logout route handling, and session invalidation. Example use cases include securing routes by requiring authentication, associating user data with requests via sessions, and triggering specific authentication flows on login endpoints.",
