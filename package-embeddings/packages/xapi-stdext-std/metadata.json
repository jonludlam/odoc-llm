      "description": "This module offers low-level string manipulation, binary data parsing, and character sequence transformations, focusing on operations like substring extraction, case conversion, UTF encoding/decoding, and integer value retrieval from binary formats. It works directly with `string` and `char` types, supporting tasks such as parsing network protocols, processing text files, and handling binary data structures. Key functionalities include efficient substring searches, hash generation, and endianness-aware integer extraction, making it suitable for system-level programming and data format conversions.",

It operates on standard lists and association lists, offering functions for key-value pair management, deduplication, and set-like operations such as intersection and subset checks. These capabilities are suited for tasks like data restructuring, configuration parsing, and algorithmic workflows requiring precise list manipulations.",

It operates on `string` and `char` types, enabling tasks like parsing binary file formats, extracting data from network packets, and transforming text encodings. Specific use cases include decoding UTF-8 streams, reading integers from binary buffers with specified endianness, and efficient string slicing and searching.",
