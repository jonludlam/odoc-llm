      "description": "The module provides list manipulation functions such as slicing, mapping, filtering, and set-like operations on association lists, including key-value updates, lookups, and intersection/difference checks. It works with arbitrary lists, association lists, and sets, offering both basic element operations and custom handling for duplicates. These tools are suited for algorithmic problem-solving scenarios, like coding challenges, though efficiency considerations advise caution with quadratic-time implementations.",

It works with strings and bytes, enabling tasks like parsing binary data, text normalization, and protocol implementation. Specific use cases include handling network byte order, processing serialized data, and performing character-level text analysis.",
