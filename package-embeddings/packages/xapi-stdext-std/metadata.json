      "description": "This module offers functions for list manipulation with a focus on tail recursion and efficiency, including slicing, mapping, filtering, and transformations, alongside utilities for managing association lists as key-value stores. It supports operations on standard lists and associative structures, enabling set-like computations, element replacement, and positional adjustments with precise index control. The tools are suited for scenarios requiring lightweight dictionary semantics, ordered list processing, or iterative transformations where performance and memory safety are critical.",

It works with built-in strings and bytes, providing functions for substring manipulation, character transformation (case conversion, mapping), integer extraction from byte sequences with endianness control, UTF-8/16/32 validation, and whitespace-sensitive text transformation. Typical use cases include parsing binary protocols, normalizing text data, and implementing encoding-aware string validation.",

It supports substring extraction, character mapping, case conversion, integer decoding from byte sequences with endianness control, and UTF-8/16/32 validation. Examples include parsing binary headers, normalizing Unicode text, and validating encoded strings. It directly works with built-in `string` and `bytes` types for low-level data processing and text transformation tasks.",

It supports set-like operations, element replacement, and precise index-based adjustments, enabling ordered list processing and lightweight dictionary semantics. You can use it to perform iterative transformations, manage associative data structures, or manipulate lists with performance-critical constraints. For example, you can filter a list of integers, update values at specific positions, or query key-value pairs in an association list efficiently.",
