It provides functions to create named or unnamed constraints, extract components like left-hand side polynomials or right-hand side values, and modify variable properties such as bounds or integrality. Concrete use cases include building LP problem constraints from polynomial expressions, inspecting constraint structure for debugging, and transforming variables within constraints for problem refinement.",

It works with structured maps that maintain key ordering, allowing traversal, comparison, and conversion to/from lists or sequences of bindings. Designed for optimization workflows, it efficiently handles scenarios requiring ordered key access, polymorphic value storage, and aggregation of computational results.",
