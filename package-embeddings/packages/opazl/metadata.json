It handles structured data types such as time, user, msg, notice, action, and line, enabling tasks like extracting message content from raw text, converting input into ASTs with positional data, and generating formatted output. Lexical analysis functions support character classification, token extraction, and substring manipulation, while AST formatting capabilities produce structured logs with timestamps and content. Examples include parsing a log line into a standardized time-user-message tuple, extracting message content from a string, and generating a human-readable log from an AST.",
