It works with database handles, prepared statements, and result sets, supporting operations like parameterized queries and reading rows. Concrete use cases include efficiently running repeated queries with varying parameters and streaming result rows from a MySQL database.",

It provides `return` to wrap pure values, `bind` (and its infix operator `>>=`) to chain computations that depend on prior results. Concrete use cases include composing database queries and identity management tasks where each step relies on the outcome of the previous.",

It supports key data types like database handles, prepared statements, and monadic wrappers for sequencing operations with error handling. You can run parameterized queries, chain database actions using `bind`, and handle success or failure outcomes in MySQL operations. Example uses include authenticated database queries, transaction pipelines, and robust error recovery during data retrieval.",
