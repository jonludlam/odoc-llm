It supports writing characters, strings, integers, and sequences of lines, with facilities for flushing, closing, and multiplexing output across multiple streams. Concrete use cases include logging to files, sending formatted data over network sockets, and capturing output into in-memory buffers.",

It provides functions for reading exact amounts of data, consuming the entire stream, and chaining multiple streams together. These streams integrate with Lwt for asynchronous I/O, enabling efficient handling of network protocols, file parsing, and data processing pipelines.",

The main data types include Unix socket addresses and Lwt I/O streams, with operations for accepting connections, handling communication, and sending requests. Servers can manage concurrent clients via separate fibers, while clients can connect to services and exchange structured data using input/output streams. Example uses include implementing an HTTP server handling multiple requests concurrently or a client fetching data from a remote TCP service.",

It supports reading exact data amounts, consuming streams, writing primitive values, and multiplexing output, enabling tasks like network protocol handling, file parsing, and logging. Examples include reading from a Unix file descriptor into a byte buffer, writing formatted strings to a network socket, or chaining multiple input streams for sequential processing. Key data types include input and output stream abstractions with operations for asynchronous reading, writing, and stream composition.",

It supports direct interaction with file descriptors, Lwt threads, and events, allowing concurrent execution of tasks such as network communication and stream processing using both Fuseau's fiber-based model and Lwt libraries. Submodules extend this integration with TCP networking, Lwt-based IO operations, and flexible stream handling for byte-level I/O across multiple sources. For example, a server can accept and handle multiple TCP clients concurrently in separate fibers, while reading and writing structured data through Lwt-backed streams.",
