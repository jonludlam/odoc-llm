      "description": "This module provides low-level file operations for working with files opened in O_DIRECT mode, ensuring I/O is performed using 4KiB page-aligned buffers. It supports opening, reading, writing, and closing files, along with functions for copying data from file descriptors, syncing writes, and seeking within files. Concrete use cases include direct disk access for virtual machine images and efficient bulk data transfers requiring precise buffer alignment.",

      "description": "This module extends system programming capabilities with utilities for file and process management, offering safe file operations, directory traversal, daemonization, and signal handling. It introduces data types like file descriptors, paths, and process IDs, enabling tasks such as atomic file updates, recursive directory removals, and inter-process communication via file descriptor passing. The child module enhances file handling by supporting O_DIRECT mode with 4KiB-aligned buffers, allowing low-level operations like aligned reads and writes, direct disk access for VM images, and efficient data copying between file descriptors. Together, they facilitate resource-safe I/O, low-level socket configuration, and precise filesystem interactions with support for timeouts and chunked streaming.",
