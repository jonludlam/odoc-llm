      "description": "Performs low-level file positioning and size adjustment, including setting the file offset with `lseek`, truncating files to a specified length via `truncate` or `ftruncate`, and retrieving metadata through `stat`, `lstat`, and `fstat`. Operates on file descriptors and file paths, returning detailed file information in the `stats` type. Used for direct manipulation of large files, such as rewinding, resizing, or inspecting file properties in system-level I/O operations.",

      "description": "Provides asynchronous, scheduler-friendly operations for file descriptors, including reading, writing, and waiting, with support for non-blocking mode to improve performance. Includes low-level file management functions like `lseek`, `truncate`, and `stat`, enabling direct control over file positioning, size, and metadata. Supports sleep, wait, and system calls that block without freezing the event loop, with specific behavior on Windows. Can be used to manage large files, monitor I/O readiness, and coordinate process execution in a non-blocking manner.",

Operates on a custom type `t` representing interrupt requests, using a dedicated signal for notification. Used to safely cancel or acknowledge timeouts on blocking system calls, ensuring proper cleanup after potential early interruptions.",

It supports file positioning with `lseek`, size adjustment via `truncate`, and metadata retrieval through `stat`, along with system-level blocking calls that integrate with event loops. It allows managing large files, monitoring I/O readiness, and coordinating processes without freezing the application. Examples include efficiently reading from or writing to files in the background and waiting for I/O events without blocking the main thread.",

It introduces a custom type `t` for handling signal-based interruptions, allowing cancellation or acknowledgment of timeouts during blocking operations. Operations include scheduling interrupts, managing signal notifications, and ensuring cleanup after early termination. This enables safe coordination of IO with signal handling, supporting scenarios like timed reads or writes that can be gracefully interrupted.",
