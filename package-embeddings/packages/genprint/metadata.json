It works with type expressions, formatters, and output values, converting typed values into structured output representations. It is used to customize how specific types are displayed in the OCaml toplevel, such as showing abstract or complex values in a user-defined format.",

It works directly with type paths, environments, and formatted output values, enabling precise control over how abstract or complex data structures are displayed. Concrete use cases include enhancing the readability of custom data types during interactive sessions and debugging by defining specialized output representations.",
