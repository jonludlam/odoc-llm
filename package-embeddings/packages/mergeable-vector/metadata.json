It supports atomic operations like insert, delete, set, and merge, with precise handling of divergent states through common ancestors and patch application. The structure allows for efficient vector manipulation at both element and character level, making it suitable for collaborative text and list editing where real-time consistency is required. Examples include synchronizing concurrent edits in a shared document or merging changes from multiple users in a distributed system.",
