It provides a structured representation of the `sockaddr_un` type through the `SockaddrUnix` module, which exposes fields to manipulate the address family and socket path. These components enable tasks like binding and connecting to Unix sockets, supporting low-level inter-process communication. Example uses include setting up Unix socket servers or clients by configuring socket addresses and interacting with system calls like `bind` or `connect`.",
