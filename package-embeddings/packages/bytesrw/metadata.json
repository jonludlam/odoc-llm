It operates on byte slices (`Slice.t`) backed by `Bytes.t`, and facilitates conversions to/from strings, bigarrays, and other byte-like types while managing invalid ranges gracefully. Typical applications include parsing binary data streams, constructing memory-efficient byte range abstractions, and implementing protocols requiring precise byte-level manipulation.",
