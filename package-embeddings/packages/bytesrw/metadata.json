      "description": "This component enables the creation and management of byte stream readers that process sequences of byte slices, supporting operations like reading from various sources (files, memory buffers, channels), pushing data back into the stream, skipping or filtering bytes through transformations (e.g., limiting ranges or reslicing), and converting streams to strings or sequences. It works with byte streams structured as ordered collections of non-empty slices terminated by an end-of-data marker, ensuring slices remain valid only until the next read operation. Typical applications include incremental parsing of large binary files, network data processing, and scenarios requiring controlled, on-demand byte consumption with error-resilient inspection or buffered I/O.",
