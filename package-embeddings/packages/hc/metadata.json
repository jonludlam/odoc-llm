It works with values of type `H.t`, using equality from module `H` to identify equivalent values and return canonical representatives. Concrete use cases include benchmarking the performance impact of hash-consing in algorithms that process symbolic data, such as term rewriting or compiler optimizations, without altering the core logic of the code.",
