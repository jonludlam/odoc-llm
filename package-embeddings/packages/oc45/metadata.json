It operates on structured data types such as training sets, decision trees, and categorized data records, enabling tasks like classification or regression. Specific use cases include building predictive models from labeled datasets and generating visual representations of tree-based decision logic.",

It works with structured datasets (`trainSet`) containing heterogeneous features and decision tree models (`decisionTree`) to represent hierarchical classification logic. Use cases include predictive modeling tasks requiring handling of mixed continuous/discrete attributes, such as medical diagnosis or financial risk assessment.",
