It operates on comparable element types using a balanced tree structure, enabling efficient cardinality tracking and deterministic element selection. Use cases include data deduplication, collection transformation pipelines, and converting between sets, lists, or sequences for ordered processing or serialization.",

A concrete use case is validating custom comparison functions used in data structures like sets or maps to ensure they maintain correct ordering semantics.",
