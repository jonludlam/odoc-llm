      "description": "Provides functions to represent and reference specific character encodings, including ASCII and UTF-8. Works with type-safe encoding identifiers, distinguishing between ASCII and UTF-8 through polymorphic variants. Used to ensure correct encoding handling in text processing and data serialization tasks.",

Operates on typed options for compile-time and search-time settings, such as case insensitivity, multiline matching, and group capturing. Used to construct precise regex behaviors by merging flags like `ignorecase` with `multiline` or `find_longest`.",

Works with the `t` type to represent different regex syntax flavors. Used to specify syntax rules in pattern matching libraries for consistent behavior across implementations.",

Combines regex options through monoid operations to define complex matching behaviors, such as case-insensitive multiline searches. Supports multiple regex syntax standards, allowing consistent pattern matching across different tools and environments. Extracts detailed match information, including group counts and byte offsets, to enable fine-grained analysis of matched text.",
