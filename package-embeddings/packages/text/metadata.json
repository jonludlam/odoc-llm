It enables tasks such as text normalization, data validation, and structured parsing through features like ASCII conversion, substring search, and pointer-based traversal. Specific use cases include processing multilingual text, ensuring encoding consistency, and preparing strings for downstream analysis or display.",

Performs encoding of code points into a bigarray, utilizing an encoder and defining the target position and size. Operates directly on bigarrays with a specific layout for efficient byte-level manipulation.",

Operates on string representations of encodings, code points as integers, and decoder/encoder state objects. Recodes strings between encodings, processes partial input, and handles errors or incomplete data during encoding and decoding.",
