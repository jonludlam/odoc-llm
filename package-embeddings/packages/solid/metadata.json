      "description": "The module provides HTTP operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, GET) for interacting with Linked Data Platform (LDP) resources, supporting RDF and non-RDF data handling, query execution, and resource folding. It works with IRIs, RDF graphs, HTTP headers, content types, and string data, enabling tasks like container management and format-specific parsing (e.g., Turtle, RDF). Use cases include managing linked data resources, processing structured content, and handling redirections with customizable exception semantics for error reporting.",
