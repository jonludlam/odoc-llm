It works with `Solid.Profile.profile` and `Iri.t`, and supports filtering and categorizing workspaces (e.g., public, private, shared). Concrete use cases include resolving user profiles in a Solid-compliant system and navigating storage and workspace hierarchies for data access.",

It supports atomic types like integers, floats, booleans, strings, and IRIs, as well as structured types such as lists, options, pairs, and triples. Use cases include serializing and deserializing configuration data to and from RDF graphs, with support for custom string representations and typed literals.",

It operates on profile structures, extracting specific fields like name, storage locations, and workspace categories such as public, private, and shared. Concrete use cases include querying a user's available workspaces, identifying their inbox location, or extracting their Solid metadata for further processing.",

It supports querying and filtering workspaces by category, extracting metadata such as WebID and inbox locations, and resolving remote profiles via HTTP. Operations include building custom workspaces with `Make`, fetching profiles by IRI, and analyzing metadata for storage and access control. Use cases range from managing user identities in Solid-compliant systems to navigating and categorizing semantic data structures for application-specific needs.",

It organizes options into groups using paths and ensures validity through built-in validation, enabling precise configuration serialization and deserialization. The child module handles conversions between OCaml and RDF representations, supporting custom literals and structured data. Together, they allow defining, grouping, validating, and persisting typed configuration values in semantic web applications.",

It provides core data types such as profiles with IRIs, triples, and metadata like WebID and inbox locations, along with typed configuration values including atomic and structured types mapped to RDF. Key operations include building and querying workspaces, resolving remote profiles, defining configuration groups with validation, and converting between OCaml and RDF representations. Examples include constructing custom user profiles, filtering semantic data by category, and serializing typed application settings for storage or exchange.",
