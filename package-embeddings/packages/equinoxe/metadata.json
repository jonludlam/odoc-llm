      "description": "This module provides device lifecycle management and configuration operations for interacting with the Equinix API, supporting actions like provisioning, deletion, power control, OS reinstallation, and rescue mode. It works with structured data types representing device configurations, identifiers, operational states, and deployment parameters such as locations and hardware plans. The module is particularly useful for debugging workflows through its configuration pretty-printing utility and for managing device states in automated infrastructure setups.",

It works with IP addresses represented by the `id` type and associated metadata including network, address, and gateway strings. Concrete use cases include retrieving IP configuration details by ID, parsing API responses into structured data, and outputting IP configuration in a human-readable format.",
