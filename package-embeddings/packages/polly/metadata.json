It works with file descriptors and flag sets to manage event notification states. Concrete use cases include signaling between threads or processes, coordinating asynchronous I/O events, and implementing custom synchronization primitives.",

It works with an abstract type representing Linux epoll event masks, enabling efficient monitoring of file descriptors for readiness notifications. Typical use cases involve event-driven systems like network servers that require precise control over I/O multiplexing and diagnostic visibility into event states.",

      "description": "This module offers low-level access to Linux's epoll API for efficient I/O multiplexing, enabling registration, modification, and removal of file descriptors with event-driven callbacks. It integrates eventfd for inter-process signaling and flag management utilities for handling epoll event masks with bitwise operations and string representations. Together, these components support building high-performance network servers that monitor socket readiness and coordinate asynchronous I/O events. Direct API operations include event loop control, while submodules enable counter-based signaling and flag set manipulation for precise event monitoring and debugging.",
