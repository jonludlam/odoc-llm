It operates on compact bitmask representations of event sets (`Polly.Events.t`), which map to Linux epoll's native event flags. Typical use cases include dynamically composing event masks for socket monitoring or inspecting active events during system call interactions.",

It works with file descriptors and flag combinations to manage event notification channels between threads or processes. Concrete use cases include signaling between epoll-managed event loops and coordinating asynchronous I/O operations without requiring pipes or sockets.",

It provides operations to register, update, and remove file descriptors from an epoll instance, and to wait for events with optional callback execution or result aggregation. Use cases include building high-performance network servers that handle many concurrent connections or implementing custom event loops for asynchronous I/O coordination.",
