      "description": "The module provides operations for combining and comparing event sets using bitwise logical operators (lor, land, lnot) and membership testing, enabling efficient manipulation of epoll event flags. It works with a custom type `t` representing epoll event masks, such as input (inp), output (out), or hangup (hup) conditions. This is particularly useful in networking applications for monitoring I/O events or handling asynchronous system notifications.",

Works with file descriptors and flag combinations to control eventfd behavior. Used to synchronize threads or processes by signaling events, such as triggering a read operation when a counter reaches a threshold.",

It supports custom types for event flags and file descriptors, enabling precise control over I/O and synchronization. Users can combine event conditions with logical operators, set non-blocking behavior, and trigger actions based on counter thresholds. Examples include monitoring socket activity, managing asynchronous signals, and coordinating thread execution via eventfd.",
