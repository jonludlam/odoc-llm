It works with byte strings and 5-bit encoded strings, enabling tasks like generating Bitcoin Segwit addresses or validating Bech32-encoded transaction data. A child module specializes in SegWit address handling, supporting network-specific variants such as Bitcoin, Testnet, and Zilliqa with concrete parameters for prefixes, versions, and checksum rules. Together, they allow constructing, validating, and decoding SegWit-compatible addresses while managing network-specific constraints and encoding requirements.",
