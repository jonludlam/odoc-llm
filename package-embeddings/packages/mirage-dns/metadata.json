It works with DNS-specific data types such as `Dns.Packet`, `Dns.Name.t`, and `Dns.Packet.q_class`, along with IP address types like `Ipaddr.V4.t`. Concrete use cases include bootstrapping network configurations in unikernels, handling DNS lookups in Mirage-based applications, and resolving domain names during network initialization without dynamic configuration.",

Works with DNS packets, IP addresses, and domain names, providing resolution via `resolve`, `gethostbyname`, and `gethostbyaddr`. Designed for use in MirageOS networking stacks where name resolution must handle both local multicast DNS and standard DNS queries.",

It supports low-level `resolve` operations for custom DNS requests and high-level `gethostbyname` and `gethostbyaddr` functions for domain-to-IP and IP-to-domain lookups. Designed for use in unikernel networking applications, it handles DNS packet construction, transmission, and response parsing directly over TCP/IP.",

It supports both standard DNS and multicast DNS (mDNS) for `.local` domains, enabling service discovery and hostname resolution in unikernel-based systems. Key operations include `resolve`, `gethostbyname`, and `gethostbyaddr`, which allow forward and reverse lookups using local and remote resolvers. Submodules enable specialized mDNS resolution and layered resolver configurations for flexible integration into MirageOS networking stacks.",

It processes incoming DNS packets, manages zone records, and generates replies, enabling the implementation of authoritative DNS services that respond to domain name resolution requests. Child modules extend this functionality by integrating with MirageOS networking and storage, allowing servers to be built from zone files or in-memory buffers and deployed in unikernel environments. Specific capabilities include serving DNS records over a network stack, loading zones from storage, and handling standard resolution queries like A, AAAA, and CNAME.",

The `Static` submodule manages DNS records via hashtables, allowing preconfigured responses without external dependencies, while the core module handles live DNS query execution over TCP/IP. Use cases include configuring embedded DNS responses, bootstrapping network setups in unikernels, and performing domain or IP lookups in Mirage-based network applications.",
