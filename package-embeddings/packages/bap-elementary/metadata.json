It operates on parameterized scheme types (`'a Scheme.t`) that encapsulate table-based approximation strategies for numerical methods. These schemes are specifically designed for code generation and symbolic manipulation in floating-point arithmetic approximations, such as optimizing performance-critical numerical computations or embedded systems where precision trade-offs are required.",
