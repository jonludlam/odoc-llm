These operations are represented as values of the `'a Scheme.t` type, enabling generic numeric computations while maintaining a consistent naming convention. It is particularly useful in numerical analysis or performance-sensitive contexts where precise, efficient approximations of standard math library functions are required.",

It supports operations on floating-point values and bitvectors, enabling precise and efficient approximations of transcendental functions like sine, cosine, exponentials, and logarithms through precomputed tables. The core abstraction is the `'a Scheme.t` type, which represents named approximation schemes for fundamental mathematical operations. For example, users can apply a preconfigured sine approximation scheme to compute values with controlled precision or define custom polynomial-based approximations for domain-specific numerical tasks.",
