It works with a map type featuring hash-conensed keys ('a hash_consed) and arbitrary values ('b), enabling efficient key management and shared representations. Specific use cases include verifying singleton maps via `is_singleton` or dynamically adjusting data structures requiring frequent updates and queries.",

It enables functional manipulation of collections, including element retrieval, quantified checks, and sequence conversions, suitable for tasks like managing unique data or performing complex set-based computations.",
