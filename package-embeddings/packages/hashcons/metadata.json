It operates on immutable sets of hash-consed elements, enabling efficient structural equality checks and memory deduplication through hash-consing. Such functionality is ideal for functional programming scenarios requiring pure operations on shared, immutable data structures where equality and hash-based optimizations are critical.",

It supports traversal, filtering, and transformation through predicates on keys or values, leveraging hash-consing to optimize structural equality and memory usage. It is particularly effective in domains like symbolic computation or compiler design, where hash-consed keys enable efficient sharing and equality checks.",

It provides hash-cons tables with customizable hash and equality functions, supporting operations like value deduplication, iteration, and table statistics; it is commonly applied in symbolic computation, AST management, and interning. The associated set and map modules offer efficient, immutable collections over hash-consed elements, enabling union, intersection, membership checks, and associative operations with optimized equality and memory sharing. A helper type with built-in hash and equality functions further simplifies defining hash-consed data, ensuring consistent and efficient value representation across all operations.",
