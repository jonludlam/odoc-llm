      "description": "This module facilitates interactive command-line interfaces in asynchronous applications by managing user input and output through deferred values. It offers utilities for prompting users with choices or yes/no questions, conditionally printing based on input, and displaying large text content via a pager, while coordinating with asynchronous job execution that includes status messaging. The `Choice` submodule structures selectable options with keys, values, and descriptions for menu-driven interfaces, and the `Job` submodule wraps async operations with formatted output to track progress and results. Examples include building configuration wizards, confirmation prompts during batch operations, and interactive viewers for log files or network responses.",
