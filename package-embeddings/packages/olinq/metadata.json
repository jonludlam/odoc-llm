      "description": "Converts between map structures and LINQ-style queryable sequences, enabling key-value pair traversal and transformation. It supports operations to adapt a map into a sequence, project a sequence back into a map, and execute the sequence to produce a final map. This is useful when filtering or transforming map entries using expressive query syntax before materializing the result as a standard map.",

It supports operations to wrap a set into a query, evaluate a query into a set, and reflect a query as a set computation. It works directly with set types from the provided `S` module and LINQ-style query expressions. Use this to integrate set operations into query pipelines or extract concrete sets from queries.",
