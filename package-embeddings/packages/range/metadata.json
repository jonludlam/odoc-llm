Supports splitting ranges for distributed processing and includes operations like fold, filter, and map. Incorporates safe and unsafe conversions between integers and constrained types, such as positive or non-zero values, ensuring type safety in critical applications. Examples include generating a range of positive integers, filtering even numbers, and splitting a large range for parallel computation.",
