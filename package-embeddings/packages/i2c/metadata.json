      "description": "This module implements low-level I2C communication primitives for interacting with I2C devices via file descriptors. It provides functions to set device addresses and perform standard I2C operations including quick writes, byte and word data transfers, block reads and writes, and process calls. These operations work directly with integer file descriptors and numeric types such as Stdint.uint8 and Stdint.uint16, reflecting the binary nature of I2C protocols. Concrete use cases include configuring and reading sensor data from hardware devices like temperature sensors, accelerometers, or EEPROMs connected over I2C buses.",
