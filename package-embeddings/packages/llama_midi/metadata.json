It supports operations like sequencing, repetition, and mapping, along with parsing big-endian 16/32-bit integers, variable-length quantities, and byte sequences, enabling structured extraction of data from binary formats like MIDI. The parsers operate on byte arrays and produce typed values, facilitating efficient processing of binary file structures.",
