      "description": "This module provides parser combinators and primitive operations for processing byte arrays, enabling precise data extraction through mapping, sequencing, branching, and repetition. It includes specialized parsers for big-endian integers (16-bit and 32-bit), variable-length quantities, and fixed-size strings, with composition supported via applicative and monadic operators like `>>|` and `>>=`. These tools are tailored for deserializing binary formats such as MIDI files, transforming raw byte sequences into structured values.",
