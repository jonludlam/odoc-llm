It provides functions to generate signing requests with subject names and alternative hostnames, encode them into TLSA records, and validate certificates against signing requests based on public key and hostname matches. It also supports DNS-based certificate discovery and management via functions to construct DNS update packets and query for TLSA records that contain certificates or CAs.",
