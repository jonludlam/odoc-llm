It provides functions to encode CSRs and certificates into TLSA records, validate certificate-hostname matches, and construct DNS update packets for certificate requests. Concrete use cases include automating DNS challenges for Let's Encrypt certificate issuance and validating TLSA records against expected certificate properties.",

It waits for a signed TLS certificate to be returned as a TLSA record, using MirageOS networking stack operations. It is used in unikernels needing automated certificate provisioning from a Let's Encrypt-compatible service before starting a TLS-dependent service like a web or mail server.",

      "description": "This module automates the process of generating cryptographic keys, submitting certificate signing requests via DNS, and retrieving signed TLS certificates for use in secure services. It handles DNS-TSIG updates and TLSA record queries over MirageOS's networking stack, enabling unikernels to establish trust with a certificate authority programmatically. The core data types include hostnames, cryptographic keys, CSRs, and TLSA records, with operations for signing, submitting, and validating certificates. For example, it can generate a private key for \"example.com\", submit its CSR to a DNS server, and wait for a TLSA record containing a Let's Encrypt-signed certificate.",
