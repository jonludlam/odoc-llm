It works with network flows, IP addresses, and ports, alongside a type `t` for connection representation. Use cases include building reliable networked applications, handling real-time data exchange, and managing connection lifecycles in asynchronous environments.",

Handles IP layer operations such as demultiplexing incoming packets, sending data with configurable fragmentation and TTL, and generating pseudoheaders for checksums. Works with IP addresses, prefixes, and network interfaces, supporting use cases like packet inspection, custom IP routing, and network diagnostics.",

It processes IP addresses, Cstruct.t, and custom types to route traffic, inspect packets, and generate checksums. Functions include sending datagrams with TTL settings, reading and writing TCP streams, and pretty-printing network-related data. Examples include building real-time messaging systems, implementing custom routing logic, and diagnosing network issues through packet analysis.",
