      "description": "This module provides monadic operations for working with result values that may fail, using the `t` type to represent these computations. It includes functions for binding, mapping, and sequencing operations, allowing developers to compose error-prone logic in a clean, functional style. The `E` submodule handles error transformations, converting exceptions into descriptive strings for consistent error reporting. Example uses include chaining file operations while handling IO errors, or validating input and propagating failures with descriptive messages.",

It processes frame headers, extracts payload data, and manages masked payloads using a combination of bit manipulation and channel I/O. Concrete use cases include reading and writing WebSocket messages directly over a network connection, handling fragmented frames, and validating frame structure during protocol negotiation.",

It provides core operations like `upgrade` for protocol switching and `handle` for message processing, enabling real-time systems such as chat servers and interactive web services. The module integrates monadic result handling for clean error propagation and includes utilities for parsing and constructing WebSocket frames with support for masking, fragmentation, and header validation. Together, these components allow developers to implement robust, full-duplex communication layers with precise control over both message flow and error handling.",

It supports concrete tasks like processing HTTP upgrade requests and packaging frames into transmittable data. The child module extends this by managing bidirectional communication streams, providing `upgrade` to switch protocols and `handle` for message flow control, using IO channels and result types for robust error handling. Together, they enable building real-time systems such as chat servers with full-duplex communication, masking support, and precise frame handling.",
