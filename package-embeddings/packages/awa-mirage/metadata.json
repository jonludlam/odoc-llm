It works with `flow` types from a provided module `F`, supporting read, write, and shutdown operations, along with SSH-specific actions like `client_of_flow` for initiating authenticated SSH sessions and `spawn_server` for handling incoming channel requests. Concrete use cases include implementing SSH servers that execute commands or allocate PTYs, and building SSH clients that connect over custom transports.",
