      "description": "This module provides efficient handling of multi-dimensional numerical data through file I/O operations that convert between NumPy's binary format and OCaml's typed memory layouts, supporting 1D-3D bigarrays and packed arrays with strict type and layout validation. It enables reading and writing arrays in C or Fortran storage formats, with support for element kinds like float32 and int64, ensuring safe and precise data interchange. The write module allows incremental export of large datasets by appending multi-dimensional arrays to a NumPy file without full in-memory loading, while the archive module supports reading and writing compressed `.npz` files, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of named numerical arrays, such as model parameters or scientific datasets. Together, these capabilities facilitate cross-language interoperability with Python and robust handling of large-scale numerical data in memory-constrained environments.",
