It bridges OCaml's typed bigarrays with NumPy's binary formats, offering safe conversions between packed array representations and layouts while handling large datasets via batched writes and compressed archives. Key applications include high-performance data interchange with Python ecosystems and memory-efficient array processing in scientific computing workflows.",
