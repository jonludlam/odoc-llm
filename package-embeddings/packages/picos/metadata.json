It operates on computation and trigger handles, enabling patterns like cancellation propagation across computations, structured concurrency abstractions via shared state, and synchronization mechanisms where fibers await results or coordinate through atomic transactions. Key applications include building efficient task cancellation layers in schedulers, managing interdependent asynchronous operations with precise lifetime control, and implementing layered concurrency models where cancellation propagates hierarchically across tasks.",
