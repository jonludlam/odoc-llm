      "description": "This module offers a minimal thread management API, including a function to determine if code is running on the main thread and primitives for basic concurrency coordination. It integrates a TLS submodule that enables creation and manipulation of thread-local storage keys, allowing per-thread state such as logging contexts or transaction handles to be safely maintained. Direct operations support thread identity checks and coordination, while the TLS submodule handles data isolation across threads using polymorphic storage. Example uses include restricting UI updates to the main thread and managing per-thread resources like database connections or debug flags.",

It provides operations to create transactions, attempt to return or cancel individual computations within a transaction context, and commit the transaction.

The module provides primitives to manage fiber state, including operations to check cancellation permissions, access fiber-local data through typed keys, and safely handle fiber identity in concurrent contexts. With fiber-local storage, developers can associate metadata like priorities or logging contexts directly with executing fibers, while unboxed optional fiber types enable efficient handling of fiber presence and identity checks in performance-critical code. Schedulers can use these capabilities to make dynamic scheduling decisions, track execution context, and coordinate effects without relying on global state.",

It supports atomic transactions across multiple computations, ensuring coordinated completion or cancellation, and provides direct operations to inspect status, attach callbacks, and propagate results or exceptions. Concrete uses include implementing event-driven systems with precise cancellation semantics, coordinating distributed operations, and building interdependent concurrent abstractions. For example, one can create a computation to represent an async I/O operation, attach a trigger to handle its result, and cancel it cleanly if a timeout elapses.",

The domain-local storage submodule enables associating typed values with domains using polymorphic keys, supporting use cases like tracking per-domain logging contexts or configuration. Together, these capabilities allow developers to write robust, domain-aware applications that maintain state and manage execution flow consistently across OCaml versions.",
