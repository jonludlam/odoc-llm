It works with Redis serialization protocol (RESP) data types, including lexemes and structured responses, using Lwt for concurrency.

It defines core data types like RESP lexemes, bulk strings, integers, and arrays, along with operations to encode commands and decode replies in a type-safe way. The async submodule handles concurrent communication using Lwt, allowing clients to send commands and stream responses asynchronously.
