It operates on `Cstruct.t` buffers for binary encoding and decoding, and uses UTF-16LE zero-padded strings for partition names.",

It supports reading and writing partition tables from specific disk sectors and includes functionality to generate protective MBRs. The partition submodule manages individual partition entries, handling GUIDs, LBA ranges, attributes, and UTF-16LE encoded names, with operations to construct, serialize, and validate entries. Examples include creating a GPT structure from a list of partitions, validating GPT headers from disk buffers, and checking if a partition entry is unused.",
