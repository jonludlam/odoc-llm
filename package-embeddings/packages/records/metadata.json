It provides the `declare` function to generate named layouts with implicit layout arguments, enabling structured data formats like configuration schemas or typed data interchange formats. The child module defines dynamic record layouts with typed fields, supporting field addition, layout sealing, and record instantiation, allowing type-safe access and modification. Together, they enable building and working with runtime-defined schemas such as dynamic forms or configuration objects, with strong static guarantees.",
