It works with IP addresses, DNS query classes and types, and domain names to perform forward and reverse lookups. Concrete use cases include resolving hostnames to IP addresses, reverse DNS lookups for IPv4 addresses, and custom DNS queries with configurable stub resolvers or system resolv.conf files.",

It handles low-level socket setup with `bind_fd`, listens for incoming DNS queries with a custom processor, and includes helpers to serve directly from zone data sources. Concrete use cases include running a DNS server that responds to queries based on predefined zone files or in-memory zone buffers.",
