It works with file descriptors, socket addresses, DNS packets, and zone data structures. Concrete use cases include setting up a DNS server that responds to queries based on predefined zone data, either loaded from files or in-memory buffers.",

It works with IP addresses, DNS packets, and domain names, handling both forward and reverse DNS queries. It is used to perform low-level DNS resolution in Unix environments, such as resolving hostnames during network connection setup or validating DNS records.",
