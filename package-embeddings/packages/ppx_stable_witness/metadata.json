It allows developers to construct and manipulate version-stable data representations directly, particularly useful when serializing or versioning data structures. Each function creates a witness that locks down the shape of a type, enabling consistent binary or sexp-based serialization.",

It combines two existing stable witnesses and uses provided conversion functions to map between the serializable representation and the target type.

It works with types that can be converted to and from a stable format using provided serialization and deserialization functions. A concrete use case is creating version-stable data structures that can be safely persisted or transmitted, such as versioned network messages or disk formats with fixed layouts.",

It provides core operations to construct witnesses that lock down type shapes, supporting both direct use and composition with other witnesses. The module works with primitive types, containers, and parameterized types, allowing transformations between serializable formats and target types using user-defined conversion functions. For example, it can wrap integers in custom identifiers, version network messages with fixed layouts, or serialize parameterized structures like lists while preserving type stability across modules.",
