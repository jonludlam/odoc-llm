      "description": "This module implements an immutable set abstraction for managing collections of unique `Subs.t` elements, supporting set algebra operations (union, intersection, difference), structural transformations (map, filter, fold), and ordered traversal. It maintains elements in a canonical order determined by the `Ord` comparator, enabling efficient membership queries, range-based slicing, and conversion to/from lists and sequences. Typical applications include tracking distinct subscriptions, computing overlaps between subscription groups, and processing ordered subsets for analysis or serialization.",

It supports sequence-based construction, bidirectional traversal, and transformations like filtering or mapping while preserving key order, alongside efficient lookups using monotonic predicates or boundary checks. These capabilities are suited for applications requiring persistent, sorted key-value storage with ordered data processing, such as incremental aggregation or event stream management.",
