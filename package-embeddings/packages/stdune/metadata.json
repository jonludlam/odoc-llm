Concrete use cases include building complex parsers, handling asynchronous operations, or sequencing validation steps where intermediate results influence subsequent actions.",

It enables custom key types to be used in ordered data structures such as maps and sets by establishing a total ordering through the `compare` function and supporting boolean comparisons via operators like `<`, `>`, and `=`. The child modules specialize these operations for specific types, implementing concrete comparison logic for types like integers, strings, or user-defined structures, and exposing both direct functions and infix operators for clarity and convenience. For example, a module derived from this interface can define how two custom record types are ordered, allowing them to be stored and queried efficiently in a map or set.",

It works with core data types like lists, maps, sets, optional and result values, strings, bytes, and polymorphic values, emphasizing functional patterns and type safety. Its child modules extend this functionality into specialized domains: monoids for value combination, options and results for safe error-aware computation, system and process utilities for low-level interaction, data structures like maps, sets, and hash tables for structured data manipulation, and formatting and parsing tools for S-expressions, strings, and terminal output. Example uses include safely parsing and transforming configuration data with result types, managing file system paths and environment variables, performing efficient list and sequence operations, and building structured error messages with contextual location data.",
