      "description": "Implements a finite set structure parameterized by an ordered type, supporting efficient insertion, deletion, and algebraic operations (union, intersection, difference) alongside ordered traversal via folding and iteration. It manipulates sets through functional transformations like mapping, filtering, and partitioning while enabling conversions to and from lists and sequences, with specialized tools for computing symmetric differences between sets. This structure is ideal for applications requiring ordered element processing, such as data analysis pipelines or algorithmic workflows where set invariants and total ordering are critical.",

      "description": "This module implements ordered map abstractions with polymorphic keys constrained by a total ordering, supporting operations like bidirectional iteration, value transformation via mapi/fmap, and set-theoretic comparisons using custom equality. It works with key-value pairs stored in balanced trees and sequence-based representations, enabling use cases such as incremental map construction from sorted streams, symmetric difference computation for version reconciliation, and ordered submap extraction with range queries. Core capabilities include atomic updates with fold-based reductions, predicate-driven filtering with partitioning, and ordered traversal patterns that maintain key invariants.",

It supports specialized use cases like managing list-valued maps (e.g., `add_to_list`), computing symmetric differences with custom equality, and performing ordered key-based queries (e.g., `find_first`, `find_last`). The design emphasizes structural manipulations and sequence-driven transformations while leveraging key ordering for consistent behavior.",
