      "description": "This module implements an immutable set abstraction built on balanced binary trees, offering operations for element manipulation (insertion, deletion, membership checks), set algebra (union, intersection, difference), and ordered traversal. It works with ordered elements via a comparator interface, supporting transformations like mapping, filtering, and folding, as well as conversions to and from sequences for iterative processing. Typical use cases include maintaining sorted collections, performing efficient set operations with logarithmic time complexity, and integrating ordered data workflows with sequence-based pipelines.",

It operates on maps (`'a t`) and key-value sequences, leveraging a total ordering from the `Ord` module to support ordered traversal, extremal binding extraction, and predicate-based queries. Typical use cases include managing hierarchical data, synchronizing ordered collections, and analyzing differences between structured datasets with customizable comparison logic.",
