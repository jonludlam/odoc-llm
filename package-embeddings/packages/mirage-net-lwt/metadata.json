It works with buffers represented as `Cstruct.t`, MAC addresses via `Macaddr.t`, and custom result and error types for network operations. Concrete use cases include sending raw Ethernet packets, listening for incoming traffic with a callback, and monitoring or resetting network interface statistics.",
