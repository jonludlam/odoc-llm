It supports converting OCaml values to Elisp equivalents, manipulating cons cells, and invoking Elisp functions as OCaml functions, with error handling that wraps exceptions into Value.t. Operations include applying private functions with parsed values, managing optional types, and serializing lists. Examples include integrating OCaml data into Emacs workflows, bridging optional values, and executing hidden operations with controlled error recovery.",
