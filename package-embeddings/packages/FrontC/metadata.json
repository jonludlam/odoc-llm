      "description": "This module implements a hash function and equality check for string values. It provides `hash` to compute an integer digest of a string and `equal` to compare two strings for equality. These operations are useful when strings are used as keys in hash tables or other data structures requiring hashing and comparison.",

      "description": "This module provides operations for managing key-value associations with specialized string keys, supporting imperative and functional manipulations such as insertion, deletion, iteration, and sequence-driven bulk updates. It operates on hash tables parameterized by value type and keyed by `Clexer.HashString.t`, with additional functions to integrate sequences of key-value pairs for batch additions, replacements, and table construction. These capabilities are particularly useful for efficiently processing dynamic collections of string-indexed data, such as parsing or transforming structured input streams.",

      "description": "This module offers operations for precise text layout control, managing indentation, line breaks, and spacing through mutable state variables tied to output channels and formatting parameters. It specializes in rendering C-like syntax, including type declarations, expressions, and abstract syntax trees (ASTs) using data structures from the `Cabs` module, such as `base_type`, `expression`, and `enum_item`. Specific applications include generating human-readable C code from ASTs, formatting complex type signatures with pointers and arrays, and preserving structural clarity in printed expressions with operator precedence handling.",

      "description": "This module performs low-level lexical analysis for C-like languages, using `Lexing.lexbuf` to tokenize input while managing stateful buffers, context stacks, and error reporting. It includes a submodule for hashing and comparing strings, which supports efficient key-based lookups, and another submodule for handling string-keyed hash tables with imperative and functional operations. Together, these components enable tasks like parsing escape sequences in string literals, tracking keyword context across tokenization phases, and transforming structured input streams with batch updates. The module's API and submodules combine to provide precise control over lexical processing, symbol resolution, and dynamic data association.",
