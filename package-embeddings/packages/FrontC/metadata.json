      "description": "This module offers operations for manipulating hash tables with string keys, including insertion, removal, lookup, iteration, and transformation, alongside functions to replace entries and construct tables from sequences of key-value pairs. It works with a hash table type where keys are represented as `HashString.t` and values can be of any type, enabling flexible data management. Use cases include dynamic configuration storage, caching systems, or scenarios requiring efficient string-based data retrieval and modification.",

It operates on abstract syntax tree (AST) elements from the Cabs module, including types, expressions, statements, and attributes, enabling recursive or sequential rendering of C language constructs. Specific use cases include generating human-readable code representations, pretty-printing ASTs, and supporting compiler or analysis tools requiring precise control over formatting and output layout.",

It operates on abstract syntax tree nodes, annotations, and C constructs like modifiers, storage classes, and operators, supporting features such as GNU attributes, C99 booleans, and inline keywords. Use cases include compiler development, static analysis, and code transformation tools requiring precise handling of C's syntax and semantics.",
