It manages transaction metadata, such as parent commits and merge conflicts, while comparing transaction states against commits. Use cases include versioned file management, conflict resolution during merges, and maintaining consistent branch states.",

Works with commit objects, tree structures, and file system-like paths within a branch. Used to monitor changes in a branch's history or specific directory structures, and to apply transactional updates safely.",
