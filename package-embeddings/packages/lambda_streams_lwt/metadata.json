Processes finite asynchronous streams and Lwt-based values, enabling coordination of event-driven data sources and parallel computations. Allows transformation of stream sequences into concrete data structures for further processing. Example uses include fetching and aggregating data from multiple asynchronous endpoints or handling real-time event streams.",
