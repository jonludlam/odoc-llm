It provides operations for creating, opening, and managing a database file, as well as adding, retrieving, and removing key-value entries with automatic compression and decompression. The module is designed for use with large datasets where storage efficiency and fast access are critical, such as caching systems or persistent storage in data processing pipelines.",

It supports standard operations like `add`, `replace`, `remove`, `mem`, and `find`, along with bulk actions such as `iter` and `fold`. Typical use cases include efficient on-disk storage of large datasets with fast lookups and incremental updates, where data is accessed by string keys and values are stored using LZ4 compression.",
