It offers `compress` and `uncompress` functions for manual manipulation of compressed data, while the `ROZ` and `RWZ` submodules expose read-only and read-write persistent hash tables that automatically compress and decompress values during access. These stores use separate data and index files to efficiently manage large datasets on disk, supporting operations like insertion, retrieval, iteration, and in-place updates. Use cases include disk-backed caches, immutable lookup tables, and efficient storage of compressed key-value pairs across sessions.",
