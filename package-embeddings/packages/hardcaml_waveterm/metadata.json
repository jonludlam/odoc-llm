It defines abstract types for configurations and time-value pairs, enabling operations like insertion, comparison, and S-expression conversion for debugging and data analysis. Users can query historical data, merge bit vectors, and generate summaries for build configurations or sensor logs. Examples include tracking hardware signal changes over time, sorting build settings, and exporting structured event records.",
