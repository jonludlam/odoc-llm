It includes errors for invalid subpattern indices, failed matches, uncaptured submatches, and invalid rewrite templates. These exceptions help diagnose specific issues in regex operations such as parsing, matching, and replacement.",

It provides functions to construct sets from lists and includes modules for serializing and deserializing sets using both S-expressions and binary formats. Concrete use cases include managing sets of strings for pattern matching and persisting or transmitting these sets efficiently.",

It works with map structures parameterized over key and value types, enabling binary serialization, hash-based equality checks, and property testing for workflows like persistent storage or randomized validation. Typical use cases include building regex-driven dispatch tables, transforming heterogeneous data with pattern-based keys, and testing map invariants under complex key-value interactions.",

It works with OCaml strings and compiled regex patterns (`Re2.t`), organizing them in ordered data structures like maps, sets, and hash tables for efficient pattern-based dispatching. Typical use cases include text parsing, log analysis, and building composable regex-driven parsers with functional combinators.",
