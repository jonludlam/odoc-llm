      "description": "This module provides combinators for building JSON decoders using a pipeline style, allowing sequential extraction and transformation of JSON fields. It operates on JSON values and decoder functions, enabling precise decoding of structured data like nested objects or arrays. Concrete use cases include parsing API responses with predictable field paths, handling optional or required fields, and composing decoders for complex data types.",

It works with JSON values and decoders that transform JSON into OCaml values, supporting operations like mapping, sequencing, and combining decoders. Concrete use cases include decoding nested JSON structures, validating JSON input, and transforming JSON fields into structured OCaml types.",

      "description": "This module decodes JSON values into OCaml values using a combination of combinators and operators that support both pipeline and applicative styles. It introduces core types like `decoder` and `t`, which represent decoding operations and decoded values, and provides operations to extract, transform, and compose decoders for handling nested structures, optional fields, and custom data types. You can use it to parse JSON API responses into typed records, validate JSON input against expected schemas, or map JSON arrays and objects into OCaml collections. Submodules enhance this functionality by offering infix operators for concise decoder composition and utilities for structured field extraction.",

Core types include encoder functions and the `decoder` type, which enables structured parsing of JSON into typed OCaml values with support for optional fields, nested structures, and custom transformations. You can use it to convert OCaml data to JSON for APIs or config files, and to decode JSON responses into records, validate input, or extract specific fields from complex JSON objects. Examples include serializing a list of integers to JSON or decoding a JSON object into a user record with optional fields.",
