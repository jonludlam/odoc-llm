It operates on a private integer type representing canonical residues modulo the fixed value, enabling overloaded unary and binary operators. It is particularly useful in scenarios requiring repeated computations under the same modulus, such as cryptographic algorithms or Project Euler problems involving large exponents and congruences.",

It works with the built-in `int` type, assuming the caller ensures that inputs and results stay within the valid range of overflowing integers. Concrete use cases include performance-critical sections of code where overflow safety is guaranteed by construction, such as in tight loops or when reimplementing safe arithmetic with custom error handling.",

It provides `solve_congruences` to find solutions for systems of linear congruences with integer coefficients and moduli. A typical use case involves determining integer solutions for simultaneous congruences, such as solving for x \u2261 a mod m and x \u2261 b mod n in cryptographic or number theory problems.",

It operates on integers and factorization representations, supporting advanced operations such as multiplicative order calculations and modular arithmetic over prime powers. These tools are particularly effective for solving problems involving number-theoretic structures, cryptographic challenges, and combinatorial optimizations rooted in prime factorization.",

It supports advanced number-theoretic operations such as greatest common divisor (GCD), least common multiple (LCM), binomial coefficients, integer logarithms, roots, and factorization utilities, all optimized for precise calculations in constrained integer ranges.
