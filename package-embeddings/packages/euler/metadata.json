      "description": "This module enables modular arithmetic computations with a fixed modulus, offering unary and binary operations like addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and inversion on integers represented as canonical residues (0 to m\u22121). It uses a private type `t` for modular values, derived from a modulus specified once via the functor parameter, and supports overloaded operators for concise expressions. It is particularly useful in number theory problems, cryptographic algorithms, or scenarios requiring repeated operations modulo a fixed integer, such as computing multiplicative orders or residue class manipulations.",

These operations are intended for use when the caller can ensure that the result will not exceed the valid range of overflowing integers, avoiding the overhead of safety checks. They are useful in performance-critical sections where overflow behavior is explicitly managed by the programmer.",

It supports both dynamic modulus passing and fixed-modulus computations through the Make functor, which introduces a private type `t` for modular values and enables operator overloading. You can solve congruences, compute modular inverses, perform repeated operations efficiently with a fixed modulus, and generate random modular elements. These capabilities are used in cryptographic algorithms, number theory, and finite ring computations.",

It provides functions to iterate forward and backward through sequences, generate lists of ordered fractions, and validate adjacency between fractions. Concrete use cases include solving number theory problems involving rational approximations and mediant properties within bounded denominators.",

It primarily works with integers and their factorizations, leveraging structures like prime power decompositions and modular arithmetic systems. Designed for computational number theory tasks, it excels in solving Project Euler problems requiring efficient prime-related calculations, cryptographic algorithm prototyping, or analyzing multiplicative functions at scale.",
