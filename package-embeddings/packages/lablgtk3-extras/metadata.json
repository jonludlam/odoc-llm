It operates on structured configuration data and parameter definitions, organizing UI layouts with containers that bind user interactions to underlying logic. Typical use cases include building customizable settings panels with dynamic validation, file selection dialogs, and type-safe input fields for application preferences.",

It supports building hierarchical configuration interfaces with sections and applying user changes through callback functions. Concrete use cases include creating GUI forms for application settings with typed input fields and hotkey assignments.",

It works with integer values representing key codes for standard and special keys (e.g., function keys, modifiers, keypad symbols) and supports international character input through mappings for Japanese kana, Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, and Hangul characters, as well as diacritics and mathematical symbols. These constants are used in graphical user interface programming, terminal emulation, and input method frameworks to process keyboard events, handle language-specific text composition, and manage windowing operations.",
