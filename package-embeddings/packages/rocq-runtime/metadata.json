      "module_path": "Dag.Make.NodeSet",
      "description": "<think> Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a 2-3 sentence description of the NodeSet module based on the provided summaries. They specified to identify main operations, data structures, and mention use cases. First, I need to parse the three function summaries. The first one talks about set operations like adding, removing, combining, and querying elements of type 'elt. It mentions returning new sets based on set theory, with optional variants and element selection. So the main operations here are standard set operations, and the data structure is a set (t) with elements of type elt. The second summary mentions searching, iterating, transforming, and querying in a sorted set. It includes finding elements via predicates, mapping, filtering, splitting. So here, the data structure is a sorted set (t) with elements of type elt, and operations include traversal and transformation. The mention of consistent ordering suggests that the set is ordered, which might be important for certain operations. The third summary is about constructing and manipulating sets of OT.t elements. It includes building from a sequence, adding elements from a sequence, and iterating in reverse. So the data structures here are sequences and sets of OT.t. The operations involve sequence-based manipulation. Now, the challenge is to combine these into a concise description. The main types of operations would be set operations (add, remove, combine), searching, iteration, transformation, and construction from sequences. The data structures are sets (t) with elements of type elt and OT.t, and sequences. The use cases might include managing collections of elements, efficient querying, and processing ordered data. But I need to avoid generic phrases. So instead of saying \"managing collections,\" maybe specify \"efficiently handling element queries and transformations.\" Also, the use cases could be things like processing ordered data structures or building sets from sequences. Wait, the third summary mentions OT.t elements. So the module works with two types: elt and OT.t? Or is OT.t a specific type of elt? The summaries mention \"elements of type elt\" and \"sets of OT.t elements.\" Maybe OT.t is a specific type used within the module. So the data structures are sets (t) containing elements of type elt or OT.t, depending on the context. But the user said not to repeat the module name. So I need to refer to the functions and data structures without mentioning NodeSet. Also, the use cases: for example, building sets from sequences, efficient manipulation of ordered sets, etc. Putting it all together: The module provides set operations like adding, removing, and combining elements, along with searching, iteration, and transformation on sorted sets. It works with ordered sets (t) containing elements of type elt or OT.t, enabling efficient manipulation and sequence-based construction. Use cases include managing dynamic collections and processing ordered data structures with predicate-based queries and transformations. Wait, but the third summary mentions OT.t specifically. So maybe I should mention both elt and OT.t. However, the first summary says \"elements of type elt,\" the third says \"sets of OT.t elements.\" So perhaps the module is generic over elt, but in some cases, OT.t is the specific type. But the user might not want to get into that. Alternatively, maybe the module is designed for OT.t elements, but the first summary is more general. Hmm. The user's instruction says to specify the data structures or types it works with. So I need to include both elt and OT.t? Or is OT.t a type within the module? The summaries mention \"elements of type elt\" and \"sets of OT.t elements.\" So maybe the module is parameterized on elt, but in some functions, it's specifically working with OT.t. But without more info, perhaps it's safer to mention both. However, the user might want to avoid that. Alternatively, maybe the module is for OT.t, and the first summary is more general. But the user's instruction says to not use generic phrases. So perhaps the answer should mention both types if they are distinct. But the user might not want to complicate it. Let me check the original summaries again. First summary: elements of type 'elt' Third summary: sets of OT.t elements. So maybe the module is designed for OT.t, but the first summary is more general. However, the user might not want to assume that. Alternatively, perhaps the module is generic, and in some cases, the elements are OT.t. But without more context, it's safer to mention both. However, the user might not want to mention both if they are not sure. Alternatively, maybe the module is for OT.t, and the first summary is a more general description. But the user's instruction says to specify the data structures or types it works with. So I need to include both. But the user said \"do not use generic phrases.\" So instead of saying \"elements of type elt,\" maybe just say \"elements\" if possible. But the summaries mention specific types. So perhaps the answer should mention",
