It is used by libraries to enforce that Lwt_eio is running before certain operations are performed, particularly when constructing configuration values or invoking entry points that depend on Lwt_eio's execution context. The token is abstract and cannot be directly created or manipulated, ensuring it is only obtained through valid initialization.",
