It works with the abstract token type `t`, which is treated as a private unit. Concrete use cases include libraries that need to verify Lwt_eio is running before executing their main functionality or configuration logic.",

It provides functions to await Lwt promises from Eio fibers and vice versa, handling both successful and failed resolutions.

      "description": "This module bridges Lwt and Eio concurrency models, enabling seamless interoperability through direct functions like `run_eio`, `run_lwt`, and `run_lwt_in_main` that manage cross-runtime execution. It supports coordination between Lwt threads and Eio domains using core types like Lwt threads and Eio event loops, while child modules introduce a runtime initialization token and bidirectional promise conversion. With these capabilities, developers can embed Lwt-based libraries into Eio applications, await Lwt promises from Eio fibers, or run Eio operations within Lwt contexts, ensuring safe and synchronized execution across both systems.",
