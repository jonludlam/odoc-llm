Accepts Lwt promises, Eio promises, and Eio promise results as inputs.

Bridges Lwt and Eio promises, allowing synchronization between Lwt threads and Eio fibers through functions that handle Lwt promises, Eio promises, and their results. This enables seamless integration of asynchronous workflows in mixed Lwt-Eio environments. For example, it allows waiting for Eio operations from Lwt code or resolving Lwt values within Eio contexts.",
