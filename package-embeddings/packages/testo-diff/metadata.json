It works with lists of comparable elements and is useful for generating human-readable differences between text lines or tokens. The main entry point is the `Make` functor, which takes a module defining element equality and returns a module with the diffing function. A child module defines a comparison interface for values of type `t`, providing a `compare` function that returns -1, 0, or 1 to indicate ordering or equality, supporting types used in diffing operations where elements must be checked for equivalence. Another child module implements a diffing algorithm that compares two arrays of items and produces a list of changes categorized as deletions, additions, or equal segments, supporting operations to compute differences between sequences and reconstruct the original inputs from the computed diff.",
