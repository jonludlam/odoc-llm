It directly manipulates memory for efficient serialization, reads and builds complex structures like Docker configs and job descriptions, and supports RPC interactions for job control, queue management, and worker monitoring. Concrete use cases include processing distributed build requests, handling worker metrics with source identification, and serializing job data for remote execution.",
