      "description": "This module orchestrates distributed system operations by integrating capabilities for job submission, worker management, and progress tracking. It centers on data types like job tickets, worker metadata, Docker configurations, and Cap'n Proto-serialized messages, enabling structured communication across nodes. Operations include submitting builds, queuing jobs, reporting progress, and managing client access, with concrete use cases such as initiating worker updates, streaming job logs, and registering nodes with task queues. The module supports dynamic job handling, secure secret injection, and type-safe serialization for cluster coordination.",
