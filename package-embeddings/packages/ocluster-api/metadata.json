Supports tasks such as initializing jobs, parsing Docker images, tracking progress through defined stages, and serializing structured data for remote execution. Includes queue operations, binary manipulation, and time-series analysis for efficient data handling and workflow automation. Examples include parsing JSON into custom types, advancing job states, and converting binary data into structured outputs.",
