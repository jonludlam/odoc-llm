      "description": "Provides operations to conditionally modify character streams based on a boolean flag, including an `elze` function that applies a stream transformation when the flag is false. Works with boolean references, character streams, and output handlers. Used to implement conditional parsing logic in a parser generator.",

Operates on custom charstream types and output structures to manage text substitution and conditional directives. Used to implement preprocessor logic, such as defining macros, checking conditions, and injecting content based on variable states.",

It handles values that can be single elements or lists, enabling use cases such as aggregating data from multiple sources or processing structured data incrementally. The functions support iterative operations and conversions between maps, sequences, and lists, facilitating flexible data manipulation workflows.",

It handles character sets specifically, enabling construction from sequences or lists and conversion to serialized string formats. Use cases include efficient character set management, data processing pipelines, and text serialization tasks.",

It operates on strings, token structures, and lists of foreign block descriptions, enabling tasks like character set manipulation and configuration adjustments. Use cases include syntax-aware string formatting, code transformation, and integrating external language blocks within a preprocessing pipeline.",

It supports operations like applying alternate transformations when a condition is false and modifying variable values to influence parsing and preprocessing. Key data types include boolean references, custom charstream structures, and output handlers, enabling precise control over text generation. Examples include conditional code inclusion, macro expansion, and dynamic content injection during parsing.",
