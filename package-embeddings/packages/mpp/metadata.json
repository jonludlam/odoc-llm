It works with character streams and output targets, handling conditional logic based on variable states. Concrete use cases include managing variable assignments during preprocessing, evaluating conditional directives, and controlling output based on variable presence or absence.",

It supports operations like `output_char`, `output_string`, `printf`, and `flush`, enabling efficient text output and stream handling. Concrete use cases include generating textual output in memory buffers or writing directly to files and standard output.",

It works with character sets represented as `Mpp_charset.t`, offering iteration, filtering, and transformation via functions like `fold`, `filter_map`, and `partition`, while also enabling conversion to strings, lists, and sequences. Typical use cases include text processing, character set analysis, and scenarios requiring efficient Unicode-aware set manipulations with predictable memory behavior.",

It works with strings, lists, and custom block descriptors to process foreign code segments with escaping and line-number preservation. This supports use cases like embedding and transforming code blocks in templating systems or multi-language preprocessors.",

      "description": "This module processes character streams by parsing and executing commands based on built-in or user-defined actions, managing environments and applying transformations with support for lazy evaluation and extensible workflows. It provides data types for commands, environments, and streams, along with operations to evaluate, route, and modify content dynamically, such as filtering text, building interpreters, or orchestrating conditional processing pipelines. The variables submodule manipulates named values within the stream context, enabling assignments, lookups, and conditional checks, while the conditionals submodule routes stream data based on boolean decisions, allowing structured branching in transformations. Together, these components support complex, state-aware text processing tasks like macro expansion, conditional inclusion, and dynamic output routing.",
