It centers around port objects that represent physical or virtual MIDI endpoints, with operations to monitor connection states and transmit byte-based MIDI signals. You can use it to build applications like live MIDI controllers, software synthesizers, or device routers that react to note events and control changes. For example, you could create a web-based sequencer that sends MIDI notes to a connected keyboard or visualizes incoming messages from a drum pad.",
