It works with a map type that supports retrieving min/max/any key-value pairs, predicate-driven searches, and conversions to/from key-value sequences. Typical use cases involve managing dynamic key-value data, processing string-indexed collections, and performing functional transformations on dictionary contents.",

It supports operations like chaining tactics with `typedThen`, applying a list of tactics in sequence with `typedLongThen`, entering a goal context with `typedGoalEnter`, and marking a tactic as independent with `typedIndependant`. These are used to build structured proof automation where tactics can return merged results, manipulate goals, and control backtracking behavior in a typed manner.",
