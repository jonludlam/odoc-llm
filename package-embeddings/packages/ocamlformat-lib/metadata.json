Includes specialized functions for bitwise operations, list pairing, and warning filtering, with examples such as bit shifting, indexed string searches, and path normalization. Offers low-level control over data representation and formatting through custom types and operators.",

It handles associativity and precedence with `t` and `Prec.t`, manages AST nodes with types like `token` and `extended_ast`, and offers low-level text layout with formatter objects and boxes. It enables tasks such as parsing documentation into ASTs, normalizing line endings, and formatting code with precise control over spacing and layout. Key operations include comment management, token classification, interval tree traversal, and configuration-driven formatting.",

It includes list operations like mapping and folding, arithmetic and bitwise functions, monadic error propagation, Unicode code point handling, and endianness-aware encoding/decoding of integers. Users can perform tasks such as parsing structured data, validating text, and working with binary protocols. Specific examples include decoding UTF-8 sequences, extracting integers from byte buffers, and chaining error-prone operations.",

It enables tasks such as generating annotated type expressions, rewriting function signatures, and pretty-printing AST nodes with customizable formatting. The module also handles lexical analysis, documentation retrieval, and parser state management, allowing for precise manipulation of OCaml code structures. Examples include inserting type annotations into docstrings, parsing partial code segments, and modifying class definitions with constraints.",
