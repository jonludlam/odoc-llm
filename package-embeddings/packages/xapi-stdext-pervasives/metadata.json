It includes functions like `finally` for running cleanup code unconditionally after an operation, and `ignore_*` functions for suppressing unused value warnings for specific types such as integers, strings, and floats. Concrete use cases include handling file or network resource cleanup and silencing unused result warnings in imperative code paths.",

      "description": "This module offers utilities for safe resource management and value handling, ensuring cleanup code runs reliably and unused values are explicitly discarded without warnings. Key operations include `finally` for executing cleanup after computations and `ignore_*` functions for suppressing unused-result warnings on specific types. It enables robust handling of resources like files or network connections, while maintaining clean, warning-free imperative code. Example uses include wrapping file operations with guaranteed closure or silencing intentional ignores of function results.",
