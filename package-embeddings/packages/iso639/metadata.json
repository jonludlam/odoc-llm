It works with abstract language types and string representations, enabling tasks like standardizing language identifiers or processing multilingual data. Specific use cases include internationalization workflows and data normalization where cross-referencing language codes across ISO standards is required.",

Supports injection into and restriction from a combined language type, and checks for presence in ISO 639-1 and 639-2.
