      "description": "This module implements operations for working with ISO 639-5 language families and groups, including equality checks, lexicographic comparison, and bidirectional conversions to and from ISO 639-5 string codes. It supports data types such as the abstract type `t` representing language families, and provides functions to convert between this type and integers, ISO 639-1 codes, and ISO 639-2 codes (both T and B variants). Concrete use cases include validating ISO 639-5 codes, converting between different ISO 639 standards, and integrating language family data into systems requiring standardized language group identifiers.",

It is designed for applications requiring hierarchical language data handling, such as linguistic databases or internationalization frameworks that need to reconcile granular languages with broader linguistic classifications.",

It works with abstract language values (`t`), code strings, and numerical identifiers, supporting both safe and partial conversions due to overlapping but distinct coverage across standards. Typical use cases include linguistic data processing, localization systems, and tools requiring interoperability between different ISO 639 code sets for natural languages.",
