It supports equality checks, lexicographic comparison, and bidirectional conversions to and from strings, integers, and other ISO 639 types. Concrete use cases include validating ISO 639-5 codes, converting between language families and their standardized identifiers, and integrating with systems requiring strict language group classifications.",

It works with individual languages and macrolanguages represented as abstract types `t`, supporting queries for language scope, macrolanguage hierarchies, and integer/ISO type mappings. It is particularly useful for applications requiring cross-standard language code conversion, such as multilingual data processing or systems integrating legacy ISO 639-1/2 datasets with modern ISO 639-3 taxonomies.",

It operates on an abstract type that unifies representations of both individual languages and collective language groups or families. This is particularly useful for applications needing to handle hierarchical or grouped language data, such as linguistic research or systems supporting macrolanguages and historical language classifications.",

      "description": "This module provides a unified interface for working with natural language codes across ISO 639 standards, enabling precise handling of individual languages, macrolanguages, and language families. It defines abstract types for languages and groups, supporting equality, comparison, and bidirectional conversions between ISO 639-1, 639-2, 639-3, and 639-5 codes. Operations include mapping between language levels, querying language scope and hierarchies, and validating standardized identifiers. Example uses include converting a language name to its ISO 639-3 code, checking if a code belongs to a macrolanguage, or determining the language family of a given language.",
