      "description": "This module provides set-theoretic operations (union, intersection, difference) and higher-order transformations (map, fold, filter) over collections of event handlers, emphasizing structural comparison and ordered element management. It employs a set-like data structure optimized for efficient membership queries, bulk sequence conversions, and ordered traversal, with direct support for adding/removing handlers and analyzing handler relationships. Its design suits scenarios requiring precise control over dynamic handler sets, such as scene graph event routing or interactive system state tracking.",
