It works with a generic stream type 'a t, enabling sequential data manipulation and composition through monadic patterns, ideal for tasks such as flattening nested structures or iterating with side effects. Specific use cases include building data pipelines and efficiently handling large sequential datasets.",

It supports operations like binding, flattening, and extracting values from structures wrapped in `'a t`, allowing for structured manipulation of asynchronous, optional, or effectful data. Users can chain operations such as parsing, state updates, or I/O handling in a clean, readable manner. For example, it facilitates combining multiple asynchronous API calls or transforming nested optional values into a single result.",
