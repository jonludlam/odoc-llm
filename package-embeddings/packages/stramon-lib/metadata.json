It supports parsing paths from strings relative to a given working directory, splitting paths into components, and normalizing segments by ignoring empty or dot-only parts. Concrete use cases include resolving file paths during process monitoring, ensuring consistent path formatting, and comparing paths for equality or ordering in tracking system calls.",

It works with typed records that model specific syscall parameters and outcomes, such as file operations, socket interactions, and permission changes. Concrete use cases include analyzing file access patterns, tracking network connections, and auditing system call behavior for security or debugging purposes.",

It operates on basic types like strings, integers, and Unix file kinds, with specific handling for C-style string encodings and file metadata. These utilities are used for parsing low-level system data, such as interpreting file types during process monitoring or decoding numeric representations in system call traces.",

It works with a generic result type `t` that holds session-specific data, along with `Stats.t` for performance metrics. Concrete use cases include retrieving session context after tracing a process, inspecting system call counts via `stats`, and handling errors using the `exn` field.",

It provides data structures like path tries and absolute paths to represent file system paths efficiently, along with syscall handlers and result tracking for monitoring process activity. Concrete use cases include detecting unauthorized file access, analyzing system call patterns, and generating behavioral profiles for security or debugging purposes. The module includes submodules for path set operations, syscall frequency tracking, normalized path manipulation, syscall event modeling, string and file utilities, hierarchical path storage via tries, and session result handling, enabling tasks such as resolving file paths, auditing system calls, and aggregating execution statistics.",
