It provides direct access to the monitoring session's result value, performance metrics, and error information. Useful for analyzing system call behavior and diagnosing failures in monitored processes.",

It supports operations like insertion, lookup, deletion, and merging of path-associated data, with precise handling of hierarchical path relationships. It is used to track file system paths observed during process monitoring, enabling fast lookups and structured aggregation of path-based events.",

It works with string lists representing path components and handles normalization by ignoring empty or dot-only segments. Concrete use cases include resolving absolute file paths from relative inputs using a current working directory and comparing path structures in process monitoring contexts.",

It works with typed records and variants that mirror syscall parameters and outcomes, such as file paths, socket addresses, and error codes. Concrete use cases include analyzing file access patterns, tracking network connections, and auditing system call behavior for security or debugging purposes.",
