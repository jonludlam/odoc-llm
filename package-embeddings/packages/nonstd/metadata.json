It supports standard and physical equality checks via paired functions like `get`/`getq` and `mem`/memq. Concrete use cases include managing dynamic key-value mappings where keys are not guaranteed to be unique and require selective extraction or filtering.",

It works with the standard OCaml `'a option` type, offering functions like `map`, `bind`, and a pipeline operator for optional values. Concrete use cases include safely unwrapping optional results, transforming optional data, and composing functions that may fail or return absent values.",

It works directly with the built-in `int` type and string representations of integers. These functions are useful in contexts requiring explicit integer handling, such as data serialization, sorting, or input parsing.",

      "description": "This module provides powerful list manipulation capabilities, including transformation, searching, sorting, and indexed operations, with specialized support for both generic and associative lists. It offers core data types like `'a list` and `('a * 'b) list`, along with operations such as `map`, `fold`, `filter`, `sort`, and indexed access, enabling tasks like sequence transformation, data aggregation, and ordered traversal. The child module extends this with dedicated functions for key-based queries and updates in association lists, such as `get`, `mem`, and `remove`, facilitating efficient handling of key-value associations. Together, they support concrete tasks like parsing structured data, optimizing algorithmic workflows, and managing dynamic mappings with guaranteed key-value integrity.",

It provides functions for formatting strings with precision across channels, buffers, and conditional contexts, while submodules support operations on optional values, integers, floats, and lists with transformations, parsing, and key-based associations. You can log formatted output to `stdout`, safely chain operations on optional values, parse and format numeric data, and manipulate both flat and associative lists with indexed and key-based access. Together, these components enable robust handling of data flows from parsing to output, integrating cleanly with OCaml\u2019s standard types and idioms.",
