It provides core data types like `t` for representing grid state, along with operations to create, update, and query cells using row and column keys. Submodules extend this functionality with dynamic table management, allowing rows and columns to be added or removed, and supporting interactive use cases like web-based spreadsheets. Additionally, configuration options enable custom initialization, UI bindings, and action handling for HTML table interfaces.",
