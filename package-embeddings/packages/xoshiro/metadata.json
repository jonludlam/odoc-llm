It works directly with `int64 array` state arrays, providing functions to advance the generator state (`next`), perform bit rotations (`rotl`), and apply jump and long jump operations for fast-forwarding the sequence. These operations are used in high-performance random number generation and parallel Monte Carlo simulations where predictable, repeatable randomness is required.",

It provides low-level access to operations like state advancement, bit rotation, and fast-forwarding via jump and long jump, enabling high-performance use in simulations, testing, and parallel Monte Carlo workflows. The main data types center around the generator's internal state represented as an `int64 array`, with operations to copy, manipulate, and serialize it for deterministic execution. Users can generate 64-bit random values with `next`, produce uniformly distributed floats in [0,1), or skip ahead in the sequence using jump functions for large-scale stochastic modeling.",

It supports explicit state initialization with seeds, state copying, and advanced state manipulation through operations like `jump` and `long_jump`, enabling reproducibility and parallelism in simulations and randomized algorithms. The main interface provides functions to generate random values directly, while the submodules expose Bigarray-based state management and low-level transitions for performance-sensitive or custom use cases. Example uses include seeding a generator for a simulation, producing random boolean values for sampling, or splitting generator states across threads using state jumps.",
