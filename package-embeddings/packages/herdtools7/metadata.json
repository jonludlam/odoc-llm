It defines core data types such as AST nodes, scopes, bitvectors, and ordered values, supporting operations like tree traversal, semantic validation, and symbolic transformation. For example, it can normalize input strings, resolve variable bindings in nested scopes, and convert ASTs to OCaml code. Additional features include lexical analysis, parsing state control, and type checking, facilitating robust language processing and tooling.",
