      "description": "This module provides functions to serialize integers and floating-point numbers in little-endian format into a buffer. It operates on `Faraday.t` serializers, writing values such as 16-bit, 32-bit, 48-bit, and 64-bit integers and 32- and 64-bit floats directly into the internal buffer. These operations are used when constructing binary protocols or file formats that require strict byte layout, such as network packets or disk-based data structures.",

      "description": "This module defines the possible reasons for a flush operation in a serializer, indicating whether the flush was triggered by a shift, a drain, or because there was no pending output. It works with the serializer's internal state to signal how and why the flush callback is invoked. Concrete use cases include controlling serialization flow based on output availability, handling backpressure from downstream consumers, and optimizing buffer management during serialization.",
