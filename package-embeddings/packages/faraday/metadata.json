It operates on an opaque serializer type, enabling direct buffer manipulation and efficient data transmission. Functions include writing integers and floats of various bit widths, scheduling raw byte sequences, and tracking flush/drain events. This allows precise control over binary data formatting for network protocols, file formats, and I/O operations.",
