It supports 16-bit, 32-bit, 48-bit, and 64-bit unsigned integers, as well as 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point numbers. These operations are useful for generating network protocols, binary file formats, or low-level data representations where byte order must be explicitly controlled.",

It works with the `t` type representing flush conditions, used to signal state changes during serialization. Concrete use cases include controlling flow in network protocols or file output where partial writes require handling.",

It provides functions to write 16-bit, 32-bit, 48-bit, and 64-bit unsigned integers, as well as 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point numbers directly into a serializer's internal buffer. These operations are used when constructing binary protocols or file formats that require strict control over numeric representation, such as network packet serialization or compact binary logging.",

      "description": "This module enables high-performance serialization through a combination of buffered and unbuffered write operations, managing an internal buffer and output queue to minimize memory copies and optimize for vectorized output. It supports direct manipulation of strings, bytes, and bigstrings, with child modules adding specialized numeric serialization in both big-endian and little-endian formats, along with flush control logic for managing output flow. You can write structured binary data efficiently, such as constructing network packets with precise byte ordering or streaming large data sets with minimal allocation overhead. The combination of fine-grained memory control and extensible output handling makes it suitable for high-throughput network services and compact binary format generation.",
