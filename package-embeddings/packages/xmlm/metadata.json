      "description": "This module provides operations for manipulating string values, including concatenation, case conversion, iteration over Unicode code points, and conversion between standard OCaml strings and UTF-8 encoded streams. It works with the abstract type `t` representing strings, supporting length retrieval, comparison, and incremental processing via folds. Concrete use cases include handling XML content encoding, parsing, and transformation tasks that require efficient string manipulation and UTF-8 stream processing.",

      "description": "This module enables streaming XML processing through signal-based parsing and serialization, converting between XML documents and sequences of signals representing depth-first tree traversals. It operates on input sources like channels or strings, handling XML features such as namespaces, encodings, and entity resolution, while output operations track depth and serialize fragments to destinations like channels or buffers. It is suited for memory-efficient parsing of large XML data or incremental generation of structured XML, avoiding full-document in-memory representations.",

      "description": "This module provides streaming XML parsing and serialization through a signal-based representation of document events, enabling incremental processing of large XML documents without full in-memory trees. It operates on input sources and output destinations using strings, buffers, and channels, while enforcing strict well-formedness and supporting features like namespace resolution, custom encodings, and indentation. Typical applications include efficient XML transformation pipelines, real-time data extraction, and handling deeply nested or oversized XML files where traditional DOM parsing is impractical.",

It provides operations to create, clear, and query buffers, as well as add individual Unicode characters and retrieve the accumulated string contents. It is used to efficiently build strings while parsing or generating XML documents in a streaming fashion.",

It transforms hierarchical data to and from tree structures, enabling memory-efficient processing of large XML files or incremental document generation. Submodules handle UTF-8 string manipulation, signal-based parsing and serialization, and buffer management for Unicode code points, allowing tasks like namespace-aware transformations, real-time data extraction, and indentation-aware XML serialization. Example uses include converting XML to custom data structures, streaming validation, and processing oversized documents without full in-memory representation.",
