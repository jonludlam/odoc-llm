It works with `Cohttp.Accept.media_range`, strings, and encoding types, supporting operations like matching accept headers, selecting preferred media types, and encoding/decoding values. Concrete use cases include negotiating response formats in REST APIs, constructing and deconstructing media types with parameters, and handling content encoding in HTTP requests and responses.",
