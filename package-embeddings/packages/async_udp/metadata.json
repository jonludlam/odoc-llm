It includes operations to check if a value is absent (`is_none`) and to extract a present value unsafely (`unsafe_value`). These functions are used to process non-blocking UDP reads where packets may or may not be available, enabling efficient polling and packet handling without unnecessary allocation or copying.",

      "description": "This module enables efficient handling of optional values within a non-blocking UDP packet reception context, specifically over `Ready_iter.t`. It provides key operations like `is_none` to check for absent values and `unsafe_value` to extract present ones, avoiding unnecessary allocations during polling. These functions allow direct and safe manipulation of UDP read results, supporting low-overhead network communication. For example, it can be used to poll for incoming UDP packets and process them only when available, without blocking or copying data unnecessarily.",

It works with integers and predefined constants to manage preallocated buffers for error numbers and message sizes. It is used internally to optimize performance in UDP applications by minimizing allocation overhead during packet processing.",

It works directly with file descriptors and Bigstring.t buffers, leveraging Iobuf conventions for efficient memory management. Concrete use cases include high-throughput UDP servers that require low-latency packet processing and precise control over buffer lifecycle.",

It supports safe and unsafe access to received data, enabling efficient handling of non-blocking UDP socket reads in event-driven servers. The optional submodule provides operations like `is_none` and `unsafe_value` to manage absence and presence of packet data without extra allocations, ideal for polling loops. The config submodule handles low-level settings and conversions for buffers and error numbers, while the polling submodule enables synchronous UDP packet processing with direct file descriptor and Bigstring.t buffer integration, suitable for high-throughput, low-latency network applications.",

It uses Iobuf-based buffering and works with any file descriptor supporting non-blocking mode, making it suitable for building UDP servers, multicast handlers, and high-throughput network pipelines. The receive loop configuration allows fine-grained control over buffer size, processing limits, and termination conditions, while the result-handling modules provide structured outcomes and error reporting for loop iterations.
