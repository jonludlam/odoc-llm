It supports operations to retrieve clock values representing real time, monotonic time, CPU execution time, and other platform-specific durations. Concrete use cases include measuring process execution time, tracking system uptime, and obtaining high-resolution timestamps for performance monitoring or event scheduling.",

It supports precise time measurement, clock setting, and sleep operations with nanosecond resolution, working with `Timespec.t` structures. Concrete use cases include measuring execution durations, implementing high-precision delays, and synchronizing events based on system or thread-specific time sources.",
