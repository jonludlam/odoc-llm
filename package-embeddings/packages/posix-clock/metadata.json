It supports operations to retrieve specific clock instances like `realtime`, `monotonic`, and `process_cputime_id`, each returning a value representing time in seconds since a specific epoch or starting point. Use cases include performance benchmarking, timing critical sections of code, and retrieving system or process-specific time values with varying precision and cost.",

      "description": "This module provides direct access to POSIX clock operations, enabling precise time retrieval, sleep delays, and synchronization using different clock sources. It works with clock identifiers and timespec structures to represent time with nanosecond precision, supporting operations like `get_time`, `set_time`, and `sleep`. The child module exposes specific clock types such as `realtime`, `monotonic`, and `process_cputime_id`, allowing high-resolution time measurements for performance benchmarking, timing critical code sections, and process-specific time tracking. Together, they enable tasks like measuring execution intervals, implementing precise delays, and querying system or CPU time across different time bases.",
