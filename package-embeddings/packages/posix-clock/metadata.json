Operates on timestamps represented as tuples of seconds and nanoseconds. Used for precise timing in system-level applications such as performance monitoring and real-time data processing.",

It supports operations like retrieving current time, calculating intervals, and tracking elapsed time with high accuracy. Applications can use it to monitor performance, synchronize events, or manage timeouts. For example, it can measure the duration of a function call or track system uptime over time.",
