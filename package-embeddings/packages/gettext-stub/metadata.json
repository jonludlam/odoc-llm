It operates on `GettextTypes.t` values, transforming them into fully initialized `GettextTypes.t'` instances by attempting to translate the empty string, a required entry in MO files. Use this module when early loading of all translations is preferred, such as in environments where predictable translation behavior is critical and many strings will be used.",
