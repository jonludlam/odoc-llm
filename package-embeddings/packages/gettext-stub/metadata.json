It operates on `GettextTypes.t` values, transforming them into fully realized translation environments (`GettextTypes.t'`). Use this module when early loading of all translations is preferred, such as in environments where translation completeness is critical at startup.",

It operates on strings and enumerated locale categories (like LC_MESSAGES), supporting functions for singular/plural translations and domain-specific lookups. Concrete use cases include implementing multilingual applications, translating UI elements, and handling regional formatting for time or currency.",

It operates on `GettextTypes.t` configurations, transforming them into realized translation environments or directly retrieving translated strings through C bindings. You can use it to preload all translations at startup or fetch individual translations on demand, ensuring integration with system-level gettext infrastructure and compiled message catalogs. For example, `realize` preloads translations into a `GettextTypes.t'` environment, while direct retrieval supports format-checked localized string generation during runtime.",
