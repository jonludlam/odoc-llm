It provides functions to generate unique window identifiers, create sub-windows at specified positions and dimensions, and close existing sub-windows using their identifiers. These operations are useful for building multi-pane visual interfaces or layered graphical applications directly within X11 environments.",

It operates on geometric primitives (points, curves, polygons), color representations (RGB, predefined hues), and pixel buffers, supporting tasks like path-based drawing, text layout, and image manipulation. Typical applications include educational visualizations, simple game development, and interactive tools requiring precise graphical control and user interaction.",
