It provides functions to load sessions from a backend using a key or HTTP headers, generate new sessions, update session values or expiration, and clear sessions, with support for cookie header generation and management. It works with backend-specific types for keys, values, and expiration periods, and is used to manage authenticated user sessions in web applications by tying session state to HTTP cookies.",

It provides operations to generate, retrieve, update, and delete session keys with associated values and expiration periods. It works with string-based keys and values, and expiration times represented as 64-bit integers, suitable for implementing session management in web applications where persistent or temporary session tracking is required.",

It supports building session management systems that tie session state to HTTP cookies, enabling authenticated user sessions in web applications. The child modules implement concrete session managers with custom backends, offering functions to load, generate, update, and clear sessions while handling cookie header generation. Together, they enable secure session handling with support for storage-specific types and expiration policies.",
