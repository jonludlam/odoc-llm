It works with time and span values to control ticking intervals and supports operations like pausing, stopping, and restarting tickers. Concrete use cases include scheduling recurring tasks, implementing rate-limited event triggers, and managing timed background processes.",

      "description": "This module combines asynchronous delay management with periodic task scheduling through its core functions and child modules. It provides time spans and Lwt thread operations for non-blocking pauses, retries with backoff, and concurrency coordination, while the child module adds ticker-based execution for recurring tasks at defined intervals. You can delay thread execution, schedule background jobs, and create pausable tickers that trigger events every specified time span. Specific uses include rate-limiting API calls, running timed background processes, and implementing interval-based updates in event-driven applications.",

It works with Lwt threads (`unit Lwt.t`) to manage concurrency in event-driven programs. Concrete use cases include implementing timeouts, rate-limiting network requests, and coordinating background tasks in GUI applications.",

It works directly with `Lwt_engine.t` to intercept and manage event sources. Use it to implement custom concurrency primitives or to sandbox asynchronous computations.",
