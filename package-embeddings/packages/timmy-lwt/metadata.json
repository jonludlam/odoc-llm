      "description": "This module wraps the Lwt event loop to provide a virtualized execution context for concurrent tasks. It allows replacing the default Lwt engine with a custom one, enabling control over asynchronous I/O scheduling. Use it to implement custom concurrency strategies or testing environments for Lwt-based applications.",

It works with floating-point values to represent time intervals and returns Lwt promises for non-blocking execution. Concrete use cases include rate-limiting network requests, implementing backoff strategies, and coordinating lightweight concurrency with precise timing.",

It works with time and span types to control scheduling, supporting operations to start, pause, stop, and finalize tickers, as well as check if a ticker skips initial ticks. Concrete use cases include implementing rate-limited event loops, periodic data polling, and timed task execution.",
