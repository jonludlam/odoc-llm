      "description": "This module provides operations for creating, modifying, and querying immutable sets of ordered elements, supporting fundamental actions like insertion, deletion, membership checks, and set algebra (union, intersection, difference). It leverages balanced binary trees to ensure efficient logarithmic-time operations while maintaining elements in sorted order, with additional utilities for element selection, decomposition, and formatting. Typical use cases include managing sorted collections, performing mathematical set operations, and scenarios requiring persistent data structures with ordered elements.",
