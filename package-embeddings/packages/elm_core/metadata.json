It includes utility functions for angle conversion between degrees, radians, and turns, as well as a clamp function for restricting values within a range. These functions are used for numerical computations in geometry, physics simulations, and graphics rendering.",

It works with balanced binary trees that maintain elements in sorted order, offering logarithmic-time complexity for key operations. Typical use cases include maintaining unique element collections, performing range queries, and leveraging sorted data structures for tasks like priority queues or ordered traversals.",
