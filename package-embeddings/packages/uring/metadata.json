It supports operations to combine flags using union (`+`) and check flag presence (`mem`), with predefined constants representing specific `statx` behaviors such as handling symbolic links, automount points, and synchronization policies. These flags are used when issuing asynchronous file metadata retrieval requests to fine-tune how paths and filesystems are accessed.",
