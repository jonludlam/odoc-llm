It supports monoid semantics via `mempty` and `mplus` (with operator `<+>`) to combine values in a monoidal context, and includes functions like `keep_if` for conditional filtering and `void` for discarding results within monadic chains. These capabilities are particularly useful for building complex workflows that interleave effects, merge optional or alternative values, or apply multi-argument transformations in a left-to",
