      "description": "This module offers comprehensive operations for managing ordered maps, including insertion, modification, deletion, and advanced merging or traversal of key-value pairs, with emphasis on maintaining order and physical equality. It works with ordered maps featuring string keys and generic values, enabling sequence-based construction and processing, as well as efficient querying and transformation via filters, mappings, and folds. Use cases include scenarios requiring ordered data manipulation, such as maintaining sorted configurations, incremental updates, or converting between map and list representations while preserving key order.",

      "description": "provides ordered map operations with string keys and arbitrary values, supporting insertion, deletion, and efficient traversal with preservation of key order. It enables sequence-based construction, filtering, mapping, and folding, along with merging of maps while maintaining structural integrity. Users can manage sorted configurations, perform incremental updates, or convert between map and list formats without losing order. Examples include maintaining ordered logs, processing hierarchical data, or building dynamic lookup tables.",
