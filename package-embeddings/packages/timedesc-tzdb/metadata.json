It works with maps where keys are strings and values are arbitrary types, offering bidirectional conversion to sequences, filtering, partitioning, and ordered iteration. It is suited for scenarios requiring efficient key-based queries and ordered data aggregation, such as time zone data management or sorted key-value storage.",
