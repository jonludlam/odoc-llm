It includes utilities for sequence-based bulk updates (`of_seq`, `to_seq`), list-valued entries, and transformations with filtering, folding, and iteration. Use cases include configuration management, ordered data aggregation, and efficient key-value transformations with structured or temporal data.",

      "description": "This module combines timezone database access with advanced dictionary operations to manage and process temporal data efficiently. It provides core types like `entry` records and `int64` timestamps, along with map structures for string-keyed data, supporting operations such as merging, traversal, and bulk updates. You can use it to convert timestamps accounting for historical timezone changes, or to manage structured configuration data with ordered key-value transformations. Specific examples include daylight saving adjustments using `entry` arrays and aggregating time-based events with dictionary folds and sequence operations.",
