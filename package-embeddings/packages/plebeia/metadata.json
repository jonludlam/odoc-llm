It supports operations for encoding, length calculation, and pretty-printing. Concrete use cases include handling binary node data in Patricia trees and preparing values for storage or transmission in systems like Tezos.",

      "description": "This module implements space-efficient binary Patricia trees with support for version control, Merkle hashing, and garbage collection, primarily used in Tezos. It provides core data types such as keys, segments, nodes (internal, leaf, bud, extender), commits, and cursors, along with operations for tree navigation, modification, serialization, and cryptographic integrity checks. You can build and verify Merkle proofs, manage hierarchical key-value data with atomic updates, track commit histories with parent-first traversal, and perform garbage collection using hash-based node tracking or stop-and-copy techniques. Specific applications include blockchain state management, versioned storage with cryptographic verification, and persistent, space-efficient tree structures for distributed systems.",
