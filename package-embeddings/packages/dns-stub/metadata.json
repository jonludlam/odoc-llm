It includes higher-order functions for mapping, filtering, and folding, along with conversions between maps and sequences, enabling use cases such as DNS flow tracking, network state management, and processing of endpoint-specific data.",

It provides functions to create and manage DNS contexts, send and receive queries, and handle connection lifecycle operations. Concrete use cases include initiating DNS lookups over TCP/UDP, managing TLS-secured DNS transports, and handling concurrent DNS requests with timeout and error handling.",

It works with TCP flows, IP addresses, and Cstruct buffers to support concrete use cases like DNS query processing, response handling, and transport-level communication. The IPM submodule tracks DNS flow state keyed by IP and port pairs, enabling efficient lookup and management of endpoint-specific DNS transactions.",

It provides functions to configure and manage DNS contexts, perform address lookups (IPv4, IPv6), query resource records, and handle raw DNS replies with support for timeouts, caching, and custom nameservers. Concrete use cases include secure DNS resolution in MirageOS unikernels, concurrent DNS request handling, and integration with network stacks for domain-to-IP lookups.",

It provides functions to connect to hosts by domain name or IP address, with configurable timeouts and retries for resolution and connection phases. Concrete use cases include establishing network connections in MirageOS-based applications, such as HTTP clients or DNS resolvers, where reliable and timed connection attempts are required.",
