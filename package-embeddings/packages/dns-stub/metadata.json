It provides connection management, message sending/receiving, and IO operations for DNS queries using IP addresses and ports. Concrete use cases include initiating DNS lookups over TCP/UDP, managing TLS-secured DNS transports, and handling asynchronous IO for DNS client interactions.",

It provides functions to connect to hosts by domain name or IP address, with configurable timeouts and retries for resolution and connection phases. Concrete use cases include initiating network connections in MirageOS-based applications, such as HTTP clients or DNS resolvers, where address resolution and connection establishment must handle both A and AAAA records efficiently.",

      "description": "This module implements a DNS client with support for IPv4 and IPv6 lookups, offering functions to query resource records, retrieve IP addresses, and handle raw DNS responses with configurable timeouts, caching, and EDNS settings. Its transport submodule manages DNS communication over MirageOS stacks, supporting TCP, UDP, and TLS with configurable nameservers, enabling secure and asynchronous DNS lookups. You can use it to resolve A and AAAA records for network connections, query custom DNS record types, and manage TLS-secured transports for enhanced privacy. The combined interface allows fine-grained control over DNS resolution workflows, from query initiation to response handling.",

      "description": "This module manages DNS message transmission over TCP and UDP, offering functions to send and receive DNS packets using Cstruct buffers with support for both single and multiple buffer writes over TCP. It handles communication with TCP flows, UDP sockets, and IP addresses, enabling concrete operations like sending DNS queries over TCP with `send_tcp_multiple` and receiving responses with `read_tcp`, while `send_udp` transmits DNS messages over UDP to a given IP and port. Submodules extend functionality for flow management, socket handling, and IP address resolution, integrating seamlessly with the core transmission logic. Specific use cases include implementing DNS clients and servers that require reliable message exchange over both transport protocols.",

      "description": "This module implements a DNS stub resolver with support for queries, updates, and zone transfers over TCP or UDP, maintaining mutable server state and tracking query metrics. It works with DNS packets, trie-based zones, and network flows to build MirageOS-based resolvers that resolve domain names, handle incoming requests, and synchronize with authoritative servers. The module integrates with submodules for DNS client operations, TCP and UDP message transmission, and network stack integration. You can resolve A and AAAA records, perform dynamic updates, send DNS messages over TCP with `send_tcp_multiple`, and establish TLS-secured transports for secure lookups.",
