It supports two data transport kinds\u2014`string` for text-based communication and `bigstring` for efficient binary data transfer\u2014allowing precise control over serialization and format in pipe-based RPC endpoints. Operations include setting up bidirectional communication channels, sending and receiving messages with guaranteed flush status, and handling transport-specific data formats. Example uses include inter-process communication where minimal delay and strict data ordering are critical, such as real-time event streaming or low-level system coordination.",
