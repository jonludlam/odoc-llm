It operates on matrices to represent state variables and evolves them over time intervals specified by the user. Common applications include simulating physical systems, chemical reactions, or population dynamics where the rate of change depends on the current state and time.",

      "description": "This module solves initial value problems for ordinary differential equations using the LSODA algorithm, working seamlessly with matrices and 1-dimensional float64 Bigarrays. It provides direct access to configurable solvers with tolerance settings, supporting both iterative solutions and step-by-step integration. The child module extends this functionality to handle systems of equations, enabling simulations of dynamic processes such as physical motion, chemical kinetics, and ecological interactions. Users can define custom ODEs and evolve their state over specified time spans, leveraging efficient numerical methods underpinning the LSODA implementation.",
