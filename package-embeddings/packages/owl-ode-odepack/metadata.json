Operates on matrix-based state representations and functions that map states and time to updated states. Used for simulating dynamic systems where the state evolves according to a defined differential equation.",

Supports both single-step advancement and interval-based solutions, enabling precise simulation of evolving states. Key operations include stepping through time and solving over ranges, with state transitions defined by user-provided functions. Examples include modeling physical systems, population dynamics, and chemical reactions.",
