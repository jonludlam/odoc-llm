      "description": "This module defines operations for interacting with sector-addressable block devices, primarily for reading from and writing to persistent storage. It works with types such as `t` for device handles, `int64` for sector addresses, and `Cstruct.t list` for buffer collections, along with error types for handling I/O failures. Concrete use cases include reading or writing raw disk sectors, querying device properties like size and sector alignment, and cleanly disconnecting from storage devices after operations complete.",

      "description": "This module provides operations for interacting with block devices, focusing on reading from and writing to sectors, managing disk access in virtualized environments, and handling storage interactions with attention to permissions and sector size. It defines core types such as `t` for device handles, `int64` for sector addresses, and `Cstruct.t list` for buffer collections, along with error types for I/O failures. Functionality includes reading/writing raw disk sectors, querying device properties like size and alignment, and cleanly disconnecting from devices. Submodules extend this capability with additional operations tailored for sector-addressable persistent storage.",
