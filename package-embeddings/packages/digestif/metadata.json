      "description": "<think> Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a module description for SHA512 based on the given chunk summaries. They specified it should be 2-3 sentences, identifying main operations, data structures, and use cases. First, I need to parse the function summaries. The first chunk talks about hash computation: initializing contexts, feeding data in various formats (bytes, strings, bigstrings), generating digests. It mentions incremental updates and direct computation, plus variants for iterators and lists. So the main operations here are hash computation, context management, and handling different data inputs. The second chunk is about HMAC generation. It uses byte sequences like Bytes.t, String.t, bigstrings, and their iterables. Features include standard and constant-time comparison, hex parsing, raw string conversion. So the operations here are HMAC generation, secure comparisons, and data format conversions. Third chunk defines types ctx and t for context and digest, but no specific operations. So the data structures are ctx and t, which are low-level. Now, the user doesn't want generic phrases or repeating the module name. So I need to avoid saying \"module SHA512\" again. The description should mention the main operations: hash computation, HMAC generation, context management. Data structures: ctx, t, byte sequences, bigstrings. Use cases: secure hashing, HMAC with different data formats, cryptographic operations needing context handling. Need to make sure it's concise. Let me check if I covered all points. Main operations: hash computation (incremental, direct), HMAC generation. Data structures: ctx, t, Bytes.t, String.t, bigstrings. Use cases: secure hashing, HMAC with various inputs, cryptographic operations. Also mention specific features like constant-time comparison and hex parsing. Avoid generic terms. Maybe start with \"This module provides...\" but the user said not to repeat the module name. Wait, the example response starts with \"This module...\" but the user said not to repeat the module name. Wait, the original instruction says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So maybe start with \"The module provides...\" but the user's example might have used \"This module\". Wait, the user's example in the problem statement shows the assistant's answer starts with \"The module provides...\" but the user's instruction says not to repeat the module name. Wait, the user's instruction says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So perhaps avoid saying \"module\" again. Hmm, maybe start with \"Provides hash computation...\" but need to check. Wait, the user's example answer (the one they provided) starts with \"The module provides...\" but the user's instruction says not to repeat the module name. Wait, maybe the user's instruction is that the assistant should not repeat the module name in the description. So the module name is SHA512, but the description shouldn't mention it again. So the description should start with \"This module...\" but the user says not to repeat the module name. Wait, maybe the user means not to use the module name in the description. So the description should not mention \"SHA512\" again. But the user's example answer does mention \"SHA512\" in the description. Wait, looking back: The user's example input has \"Module: SHA512\" and the example output is: \"The module provides hash computation and HMAC generation functionalities, operating on byte sequences, bigstrings, and iterable data structures. It supports incremental updates, secure comparisons, and format conversions, suitable for cryptographic applications requiring secure hashing and message authentication.\" So in that example, the module name isn't repeated. The example starts with \"The module provides...\" which is acceptable. So the user's instruction says not to repeat the module name, so the description shouldn't mention \"SHA512\" again. So the answer should not include the module name. So the example answer is correct. So, in my case, I need to write a description that doesn't mention \"SHA512\" again. So start with \"Provides hash computation...\" but the user's example starts with \"The module provides...\". Maybe that's acceptable as long as the module name isn't repeated. So the key is to avoid using the module name in the description. So, putting it all together: The main operations are hash computation (incremental, direct), HMAC generation, context management. Data structures: ctx, t, byte sequences (Bytes.t, String.t, bigstrings), iterable data. Use cases: secure hashing, HMAC with different data formats, cryptographic applications needing context handling. Also mention specific features like constant-time comparison, hex parsing, raw string conversion. Now, structure into 2-3 sentences. First sentence: main operations and data structures. Second: specific use cases and features. Check for generic phrases. Avoid \"various formats\" maybe? But the user's example uses \"iterable data structures\" which is specific. So maybe okay. So: Provides hash computation",

      "description": "<think> Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a 2-3 sentence description of the KECCAK_256 module based on the provided summaries. They specified to identify main operations, data structures, and mention use cases without generic phrases or repeating the module name. First, I need to parse the function/type summaries. The first summary mentions initializing contexts, feeding data in bytes, strings, bigstrings, and computing digests or HMACs. So the main operations are hash computation and HMAC generation. The data structures are byte sequences, strings, bigstrings. Use cases could be secure data hashing and message authentication. The second summary talks about HMAC with secret keys, various data structures again, and utilities for converting between formats like hex and raw bytes. Also comparison and pretty-printing. So maybe mention HMAC generation with different input types and conversion utilities as use cases. Third summary mentions context for computing hashes and representing the hash value. So context management and output representation are part of the operations. Putting it together: main operations are hash computation (incremental and direct) and HMAC generation. Data structures are byte sequences, strings, bigstrings. Use cases include secure hashing and message authentication. Also, conversion between formats and utilities like comparison. Need to avoid generic terms. Instead of \"data structures\" maybe specify \"byte sequences, strings, and bigstrings\". Use cases could be \"secure data integrity checks\" or \"message authentication with secret keys\". Check if the module name is mentioned. The user said not to repeat the module name, so avoid \"KECCAK_256\" in the description. Also, ensure it's 2-3 sentences. Let me draft: The module offers functions for computing KECCAK-256 hashes and generating HMACs using secret keys, supporting byte sequences, strings, and bigstrings with both incremental updates and direct computation. It includes utilities for converting hash outputs to hexadecimal or raw bytes, along with comparison and formatting tools, suitable for applications requiring secure data integrity checks or authenticated messaging. Wait, but the user said not to use the module name. The first sentence mentions KECCAK-256, which is part of the module's name. But the user said not to repeat the module name. Wait, the module is called KECCAK_256, but the description should not use the module name. So maybe refer to the algorithm as \"KECCAK-256\" but not the module name. The user's instruction says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So perhaps it's okay to mention the algorithm name. Let me check the original query again. The user says: \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So the module name is KECCAK_256, so the description shouldn't repeat that. But the algorithm is called KECCAK-256. So maybe it's acceptable to mention the algorithm name. However, the user might consider \"KECCAK-256\" as part of the module name. Hmm. The module documentation says \"KECCAK 256 hash algorithm.since 1.1.0\" so maybe the algorithm is named KECCAK-256. So perhaps it's okay to mention it. But the user's instruction is to not repeat the module name. So maybe the answer should refer to the algorithm without the module name. But the user's example in the query has the module name as KECCAK_256, so maybe it's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to avoid mentioning the module name but the algorithm name is okay. This is a bit ambiguous. But given the function summaries mention KECCAK-256, it's probably safe to include it. So the final answer would be something like: The module provides functions for computing KECCAK-256 hashes and generating HMACs with secret keys, supporting byte sequences, strings, and bigstrings through incremental updates or direct computation. It includes utilities for converting hash outputs to hexadecimal or raw bytes, along with comparison and formatting tools, suitable for secure data integrity checks or authenticated messaging applications. That's two sentences. Maybe add a third for use cases. But the user said 2-3. Let me check the original summaries again. The use cases mentioned in the summaries are secure data hashing, message authentication, and handling cryptographic data. So maybe the third sentence can mention specific use cases like \"secure data integrity checks\" or \"authenticated messaging\". Alternatively, the second sentence can include the use cases. Let me adjust: The module provides functions for computing KECCAK-256 hashes and generating HMACs with secret keys, supporting byte sequences, strings, and bigstrings through incremental updates or direct computation. It includes utilities for converting hash outputs to hexadecimal or raw bytes, along with comparison and formatting tools, enabling secure data integrity checks and authenticated messaging applications. That's two sentences. Maybe that's sufficient. I think this meets the requirements: identifies",
