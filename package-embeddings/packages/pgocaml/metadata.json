It operates on PostgreSQL-specific types (e.g., `oid`, `timestamptz`, `jsonb`, `hstore`, arrays) and their OCaml representations, with utilities for serialization, parsing, and monadic composition. Use cases include type-safe query execution with parameterized statements, transactional integrity in data-modifying operations, and bidirectional conversion of complex data types (UUIDs, intervals, arrays) for storage or analysis.",

It operates on database handles, connection descriptors, and PostgreSQL types like `timestamptz`, `jsonb`, and `uuid`, supporting operations such as parameterized query execution, prepared statement management, and bidirectional conversion of arrays and custom types. Specific use cases include building transactional applications, handling complex data formats like geospatial or time-series data, and ensuring safe mapping between OCaml and PostgreSQL type systems.",

It operates on standard `string` values and `PGOCaml_aux.String.t` types, providing functions for substring operations, case conversion, UTF-8/16 decoding, and parsing integers of varying bit-widths/endianess from string buffers. These tools are particularly useful for low-level text processing, network protocol implementations, and binary file format parsing where precise string manipulation and encoding validation are required.",

It operates on polymorphic lists (`'a list`) and pairs (`('a * 'b) list`), emphasizing functional patterns like tail recursion, predicate-driven selection, and ordered processing. Use cases include building data pipelines with transformations and filters, managing key-value associations, sorting with custom comparisons, and handling indexed or conditional list manipulations for tasks like partitioning or slicing.",

It provides core operations for executing queries, handling connections, and managing transactions, while integrating with submodules for asynchronous I/O, connection lifecycle management, and advanced type serialization. Use it to safely run SQL statements with typed parameters, retrieve structured data from result sets, or handle complex types like arrays and custom user-defined types in a type-preserving way. Submodules extend this functionality with async support, transaction control via `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`, and utilities for working with PostgreSQL's extended type system.",

It enables transaction control with isolation levels and provides monadic sequencing for safe composition of database operations. The child module extends this with asynchronous I/O, allowing non-blocking communication with PostgreSQL using custom channel types for reading and writing binary data directly over sockets. Together, they support building concurrent, type-safe applications that perform efficient, thread-aware database interactions, such as executing prepared statements, streaming query results, and handling custom PostgreSQL types in a binary wire protocol.",
