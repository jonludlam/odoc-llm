It includes functions to retrieve a value from an option, apply a function to the value inside an option, and provide a default value when none is present. These functions are used to safely manipulate `'a option` types in cases like parsing database results or handling missing configuration values.",

      "description": "This module offers structural list manipulation, transformation, and traversal operations, including safe element access, indexed mapping, filtering, folding, and comparison with customizable equality checks. It primarily works with polymorphic lists (`'a list`) and association lists (`('a * 'b) list`), supporting tasks like hierarchical data flattening, key-value lookups, and sequence conversions. Specific use cases include building data processing pipelines with `fold_left_map`, sorting heterogeneous elements via custom comparators, and efficiently partitioning or merging lists with guaranteed tail recursion.",

It operates on database handles, SQL queries, parameter lists, and result sets, supporting complex types like `jsonb`, `uuid`, `timestamptz`, and arrays of optional values. Key use cases include executing parameterized queries with strong type guarantees, converting between OCaml and PostgreSQL representations for custom data types, and managing transaction isolation levels or sequence values in persistent storage systems.",

It handles binary data interpretation through low-level functions for UTF validation, byte indexing, and integer extraction, while providing utilities for converting between strings and other data representations. These capabilities make it suitable for text processing, binary protocol parsing, and hash-based data management tasks.",

It works with custom `in_channel` and `out_channel` types to manage non-blocking socket communication. Concrete use cases include writing asynchronous network clients and servers that handle PostgreSQL protocol messages over Unix sockets.",

It works directly with database connections, SQL statements, parameters, and result sets, supporting advanced SQL types like `jsonb`, `uuid`, and arrays. It is used to enforce type correctness in database interactions, convert custom OCaml types to and from PostgreSQL representations, and handle transactions with precise isolation controls.",
