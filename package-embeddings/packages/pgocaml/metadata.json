It works with strings, bytes, and integer types like int32 and int64, enabling tasks such as parsing binary protocols, handling network data (big-endian), and processing encoded text. Specific use cases include validating binary formats, converting between numeric representations, and extracting structured data from raw string buffers.",

It works with lists of arbitrary elements, key-value pairs, and sequences, enabling use cases like data transformation pipelines, structured data processing, and merging multiple data sources efficiently. Specific functions support indexed operations, early-exit behaviors, and conversion between list and sequence representations.",
