      "description": "The module supports parsing, creation, and metadata manipulation of encoded data packets, focusing on fields like timestamps (PTS/DTS), duration, stream indices, and flags. It handles packet content through byte-level serialization/deserialization and string-based representations, while also managing auxiliary data such as replay gain and custom metadata. This enables use cases like stream synchronization, container format parsing, and metadata tagging in multimedia pipelines.",

It works with enumerated codec IDs like `Srt`, `Ass`, and `Webvtt`, and interacts with codec descriptors and parameters. Concrete use cases include selecting an SRT encoder for outputting subtitles or decoding a DVD subtitle stream using its ID.",

It works with filter configurations, codec parameters, and packets containing raw bitstream data. Use it to process streams with specific transformations like header rewriting or format conversion before decoding or after encoding.",

It works with the `id` type, which represents various unknown codec types like `Ttf`, `Scte_35`, and `Mpeg2ts`, and operates on `Avcodec.params` values. It is used to handle and identify unsupported or specialized codecs during media processing tasks.",

It targets codec descriptors, parameter structures, and stream configurations to enable precise control over audio processing pipelines. Typical use cases include implementing custom audio encoding workflows, analyzing media file properties, or building low-level audio processing tools requiring direct interaction with codec-specific settings.",

It operates on video codec identifiers, parameter structures, and hardware contexts to configure properties such as resolution, bit rate, and aspect ratios. This enables use cases like initializing decoders for specific formats, optimizing encoding settings, or inspecting codec constraints for video processing pipelines.",
