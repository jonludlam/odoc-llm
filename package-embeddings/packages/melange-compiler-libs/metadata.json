It includes functions to check if a type is a function or base type, determine if a value is a pointer or immediate, and classify array and bigarray kinds and layouts. These operations are used during compilation to optimize and correctly emit low-level code for values, functions, and data structures based on their types.",

It works directly with data types like `lambda`, `primitive`, `structured_constant`, and `value_kind`, primarily from the `Melange_compiler_libs.Lambda` module. These functions are used during compilation to inspect and debug Lambda code, such as printing the structure of constants or the details of lambda programs.",
