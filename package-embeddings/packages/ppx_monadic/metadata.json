Operates on OCaml AST nodes, including expressions and long identifiers, with location information. Used to transform do-notation into monadic bind operations during macro expansion.",

Operates on OCaml AST nodes, specifically expressions and case structures, and integrates with the AST mapper for deeper transformations.
