It works directly with the `Optint.Int63.Boxed.t` type, enabling precise integer calculations and bit manipulation. Concrete use cases include numerical computations requiring exact 63-bit behavior and low-level bit operations in systems programming.",

It works directly with the `Optint.Int63.t` type, enabling precise numerical computations that avoid overflow issues inherent in native integers. Concrete use cases include high-precision counters, cryptographic calculations, and systems-level programming where exact bit-width control is required.",

      "description": "This module implements arithmetic, bitwise, and conversion operations for 63-bit signed integers stored in a heap-allocated boxed representation, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms regardless of native word size. It supports precise numerical computations and bit manipulation through operations like addition, multiplication, logical shifts, and bitwise operations, along with conversions to/from other integer types (including unsafe unsigned truncations) and string representations. Designed for systems programming scenarios requiring exact 63-bit semantics, it handles edge cases like division by zero predictably and provides utilities for binary serialization and cross-type comparisons.",
