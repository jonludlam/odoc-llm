It provides infix operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `land`, `lor`, `lsl`, and `lsr` that operate directly on `Optint.Int63.t` values. These operations are useful for low-level numerical computations where overflow control and bit manipulation are required, such as in systems programming or implementing custom data structures.",

It enables precise numerical computations and low-level bit manipulation, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms regardless of word size. Direct operations work on boxed integer values, while submodules extend functionality for comparisons, conversions, and more specialized bit-level operations. Example uses include cryptographic calculations and systems programming tasks where exact overflow and representation control are critical.",
