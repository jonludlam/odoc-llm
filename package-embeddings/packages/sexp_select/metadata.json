It handles custom types `ident` and `t`, supporting serialization, deserialization, and string comparison. This allows for precise identification and manipulation of action identifiers in rule-based systems. For example, it can parse a string into an identifier, compare it against a pattern, or convert an identifier back to its string form.",

It handles atoms like exact strings, sets of strings, and special symbols for wildcards and direct children. Use cases include querying nested data structures, filtering specific fields, and navigating hierarchical S-expression trees.",

It supports `ident` and `t` types with serialization, deserialization, and pattern matching, allowing for efficient identification and filtering of structured data. Operations include parsing strings into patterns, comparing identifiers against templates, and navigating nested S-expression hierarchies. For example, it can transform a string into an identifier, match it against a pattern, or extract specific fields from a complex data structure.",
