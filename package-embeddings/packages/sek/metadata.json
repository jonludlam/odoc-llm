It provides core data types including mutable and immutable sequences, array segments, and sequence-backed stacks, queues, and arrays, with operations for in-place mutation, bulk transformation, iteration, and safe element access. You can use it to implement stack-based algorithms with mutable sequences, process subarrays using validated segments, unify data structure operations under a common sequence model, or manage immutable snapshots for concurrent access. Examples include merging sorted sequences, performing in-place sorting, validating array bounds during traversal, and replacing standard data structures with sequence-based equivalents for consistent mutation and interoperation.",
