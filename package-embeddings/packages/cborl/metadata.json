It supports operations to convert CBOR items to and from signal sequences, read and write signals directly to byte streams, and construct or parse indefinite-length arrays and maps. Concrete use cases include streaming large CBOR structures without full in-memory representation and handling CBOR extensions like tags and floating-point values.",

It provides direct encoding of these items to byte sequences and decoding from byte sequences back to structured items. Concrete use cases include efficient data interchange with external systems, handling tagged or custom CBOR extensions, and working with large CBOR structures through streaming interfaces provided by the Signal module.",
