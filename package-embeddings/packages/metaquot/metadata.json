It operates directly on OCaml's AST structures, enabling the use of custom syntax extensions that represent quoted OCaml code. This is specifically used to implement language-level features like embedding and manipulating code fragments within OCaml programs.",

These capabilities enable meta-programming tasks like ppx rewriters that analyze or generate OCaml code through pattern matching on quoted syntax.",
