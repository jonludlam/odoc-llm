Supports retrieval of interface-specific data such as MAC address and MTU. Allows for sending raw frames, parsing received data, and routing packets to protocol-specific handlers. Example tasks include crafting custom Ethernet packets, inspecting incoming traffic, and interfacing with higher-layer protocols like ARP or IP.",
