It works with IPv4 addresses (`Ipaddr.V4.t`), MAC addresses (`Macaddr.t`), and Ethernet frames (`Cstruct.t`). Concrete use cases include handling incoming ARP requests and responses, updating the ARP cache, resolving MAC addresses for IP destinations, and managing IP bindings with automatic GARP announcements.",

      "description": "This module handles ARP operations for IPv4 networks, providing functions to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses, manage the ARP cache, and send GARP packets. It works with key data types such as `Ipaddr.V4.t` for IPv4 addresses, `Macaddr.t` for MAC addresses, and `Cstruct.t` for Ethernet frames. Use it to process incoming ARP requests, update ARP entries, and manage IP-to-MAC bindings with automatic GARP announcements. Example tasks include responding to ARP queries and refreshing network interface bindings.",
