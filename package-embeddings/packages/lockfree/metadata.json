It works with the generic `'a t` type representing the queue, supporting any element type `'a`. Designed for architectures lacking FAD instructions, it offers better performance on ARM but sacrifices efficiency on x86 compared to the standard implementation.",

It operates on a pre-allocated, fixed-size buffer and supports `push` and `pop` operations that block via spinning until space or data becomes available. It is suited for high-throughput, low-latency scenarios where predictable memory usage and avoidance of dynamic allocation are critical, such as in real-time systems or high-performance servers.",

It provides immediate-returning `push` and `pop` operations, making it suitable for concurrent pipelines, task scheduling, and event queues under a fair OS scheduler. The main data type `'a t` represents the queue and supports operations that avoid indefinite busy-waiting, with child modules offering CAS-based variants optimized for architectures like ARM where FAD instructions are unavailable. Specific use cases include coordinating work between threads in a server or managing asynchronous events in a GUI application.",

      "description": "This module implements a high-throughput, thread-safe queue with relaxed FIFO semantics, offering two distinct interfaces for different concurrency strategies. The `Spin` interface provides lock-free `push` and `pop` operations that busy-wait on full or empty states, ideal for real-time systems with fixed memory constraints, while the `Not_lockfree` interface offers cooperative, non-lockfree paths that return immediately and support overflow handling. The main data type `'a t` represents the queue, enabling concurrent producers and consumers to exchange data efficiently, with use cases ranging from task scheduling in servers to event handling in GUIs. Child modules refine these behaviors with architecture-specific optimizations and alternative synchronization mechanisms.",
