      "description": "This module offers functionality for managing device-related API operations, focusing on lifecycle management (creation, deletion, state queries) and attribute configuration (OS, hardware plans, geolocation). It works with structured data types representing device configurations, control actions (like power toggling), and event streams, while providing utilities for inspecting configuration states. Specific use cases include debugging device setups via human-readable output and orchestrating device operations in cloud infrastructure scenarios.",
