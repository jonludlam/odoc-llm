It provides stream-based processing of command output, with functions to capture exit status, stdout, stderr, and handle timeouts, while requiring explicit lifecycle management to prevent orphaned processes. Child modules extend this capability with utilities for formatting results and managing external program execution in async contexts. Example uses include remote server automation, distributed system interactions, and asynchronous task execution with partial output handling.",
