It provides functions to execute commands, wait for completion, and format error messages from failed executions. Suitable for running external tools like compilers, linters, or system utilities while handling their output and termination states directly.",

      "description": "This module enables asynchronous execution of shell and SSH commands with support for capturing output streams, error messages, and exit codes through deferred values and stream-based interfaces. It operates on command strings, remote hosts, and file paths, offering utilities for remote directory creation, file copying, and line-by-line or full-output processing. It is suited for scenarios requiring explicit control over child process termination and remote system interactions, though care must be taken to handle partial output buffering and orphaned processes.",
