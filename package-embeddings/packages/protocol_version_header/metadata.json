It supports serialization via `Bin_prot` and S-expressions, including functions for reading, writing, and measuring values of this bounded list type. The primary use case is to safely handle protocol headers that contain lists with a fixed upper bound on their length, ensuring that overly long lists are rejected early during parsing.",

      "description": "This module defines an enumerated type representing specific protocols such as Kerberos, test mode, and RPC, each identified by a unique magic number for use in version negotiation and header identification during network connections. It supports mapping protocols to and from their magic numbers, comparison, and S-expression-based serialization and deserialization. The child module extends this functionality by providing test-specific metadata and utilities for manipulating protocol versions and magic numbers, enabling validation of version negotiation and error handling for unsupported protocols. Together, they allow concrete operations such as serializing a protocol to an S-expression, parsing a magic number from a connection header, and testing protocol version compatibility.",

It facilitates comparing and handling version mismatches by pairing the expected and received protocol versions. Concrete use cases include tracking client-server protocol compatibility and managing header data exchange during connection setup.",

It operates on the `Protocol_version_header.t` type, which encapsulates version and magic number data for protocol negotiation. Use it to inspect or construct protocol headers explicitly, such as when implementing custom version checks or handling special connection setup logic.",

It works with string-based magic numbers and integer versions, enforcing limits on version ranges and header metadata. The bounded list submodule enforces maximum length constraints on protocol headers, supporting safe parsing and serialization via `Bin_prot` and S-expressions. Example uses include verifying protocol negotiation and rejecting malformed headers with overly long lists.",

It defines a structured header type that encapsulates version ranges and auxiliary identifiers, supporting operations such as version comparison, magic number parsing, and explicit header construction. Child modules provide enumerated protocols with serialization, paired headers for endpoint negotiation, raw version list access, and bounded header validation. Example uses include negotiating protocol versions between client and server, embedding service-specific identifiers in headers, and validating connection metadata against known protocols.",
