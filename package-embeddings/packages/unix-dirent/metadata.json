It includes a core type `t` for representing file kinds and functions to translate between these values and a generalized definition type for cross-platform interoperability. You can use it to interpret raw file type data from system calls, or to serialize file metadata for logging and configuration files. Submodule functions extend this capability by handling conversions needed during cross-platform data exchange.",
