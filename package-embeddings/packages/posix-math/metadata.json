It supports `float` and `complex` types, offering functions like `cabs`, `log10`, `lround`, and `atan2`, while enabling management of rounding modes, exception flags, and environment settings. Submodules allow setting rounding direction, querying and handling floating-point exceptions, and manipulating global floating-point state, enabling use cases such as error-resilient numerical algorithms and financial computations requiring strict precision. Direct operations integrate seamlessly with environment controls to support scientific computing and robust numerical analysis.",
