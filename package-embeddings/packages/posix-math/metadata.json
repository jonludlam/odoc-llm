It supports precise numerical computations through floating-point environment control, exception handling, and rounding mode adjustments, working with `float`, `complex`, and specialized state types for error flags and environment settings. Key use cases include scientific simulations requiring strict IEEE 754 compliance, signal processing with complex arithmetic, and financial calculations needing controlled rounding behavior.",
