It supports operations to insert, remove, fold, and filter entries while ensuring type-correct associations through a GADT, enabling precise handling of DNS zone data and integration with protocols like ACME and DNSSEC. Submodules provide ordered, immutable sets for specific record types\u2014such as TXT, MX, TLSA, and DS\u2014supporting set algebra, transformations, and ordered traversal, which are used in tasks like certificate validation, service discovery, and secure delegation. The combination of the core map and specialized sets allows for structured, efficient manipulation of DNS data across diverse use cases including dynamic DNS updates, DNSSEC signing, and service configuration validation.",
