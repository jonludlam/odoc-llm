It operates on polyhedral structures with linear/tree constraints, Polka strict abstractions, and variable mappings in Apron environments, supporting queries for bounds, projections, and 2D vertex extraction. These capabilities are used in program analysis to verify numerical properties, optimize domain transitions, and analyze geometric relationships in abstract interpretations.",
