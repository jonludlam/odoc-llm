It works with S-expressions as both input and output, enabling serialization and deserialization of formatting settings for use cases such as dynamic configuration of pretty-printers or storing display preferences. Specific applications include adjusting visual styles for code editors, enforcing formatting thresholds in debuggers, or tailoring output for readability in command-line tools.",

It includes functions to convert S-expressions with layout information into normalized forms, preserving structure and associated comments. Useful for formatting and transforming Lisp-like data structures while maintaining readability and layout fidelity.",

It provides core operations for rendering `Base.Sexp.t` and `Sexplib.Sexp.With_layout.t_or_comment` values with customizable formatting options such as indentation, color, and comment handling. Submodules enable configuration of layout rules, normalization of S-expressions with comments, and targeted output to formatters, buffers, or channels. Examples include generating readable Lisp-like code, formatting configuration data with preserved comments, and customizing output appearance for tools like debuggers or command-line interfaces.",
