It supports TOML-specific key handling through its key module, which manages string conversion, comparison, and ordering, making it suitable for configuration parsing and structured data manipulation. You can, for example, load a TOML configuration into a table, filter out unwanted entries, and transform values across all key-value pairs. The module also allows conversion between tables and ordered lists of bindings, enabling precise control over serialization and traversal order.",
