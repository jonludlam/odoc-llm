It supports initializing uploads, uploading or copying individual parts, and completing or aborting the process, working with types like `t` and operations such as `initiate`, `upload_part`, and `complete`. The child module extends this functionality by enabling streaming uploads using Lwt and `Pipe.reader`, allowing large data streams\u2014such as those from a socket or file\u2014to be uploaded in configurable chunks without full in-memory loading.
