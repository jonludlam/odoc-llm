It provides functions to create a channel, write boolean values to the channel with or without backpressure, and read boolean values from the channel. Concrete use cases include coordinating state changes between threads or managing binary signals in event-driven systems.",

It supports operations to send integers with optional flow control and receive them, making it suitable for producer-consumer scenarios or inter-process communication. Concrete use cases include coordinating data flow between concurrent tasks or managing resource-limited streams of integer-based signals.",

Its child modules extend this foundation with communication channels for asynchronous data transfer, supporting typed streams of boolean, integer, character, string, and custom `Material.t` values with flow control and backpressure handling. You can build validation pipelines that transform input data step-by-step, then stream the results through concurrent components using typed channels for coordinated processing. Operations include `map` and `filter` for inline transformations, `write` and `read` for asynchronous communication, and `chain` to link processing stages with channel-based outputs.",
