      "description": "This module implements splay tree-based maps with ordered keys, automatically optimizing access patterns by promoting recently used elements to the root. It provides key-value operations such as lookup with `-->`, insertion with `<--`, and transformations via `map`, along with safe selection and filtering functions. You can efficiently retrieve recent entries, update values based on keys, or traverse the structure with custom folds, all while benefiting from self-adjusting tree reorganization during access. It is ideal for single-threaded scenarios where access patterns exhibit locality.",

      "description": "This module defines core type signatures for common data structure behaviors, including mappable, ordered, and monadic structures. It provides essential interfaces like `Mappable`, `OrderedType`, and `Monad`, enabling consistent abstractions across different data types. These interfaces support operations such as mapping over containers, comparing values, and chaining computations, primarily used in implementing and generalizing data structures and functional pipelines. For example, `Mappable` allows transforming elements in custom containers like trees, `Monad` enables chaining operations over optional or error-prone values, and `OrderedType` supports building sets and maps with strict ordering requirements.",

It includes monadic operations for composing result-returning functions, allowing error propagation through chaining with operators like `(>>=)`, particularly useful for workflows like parsing or I/O. It supports exception catching and conversion to types like options and lists, enabling integration with different error-handling styles. For example, you can sequence file reads or validations while handling errors at the end of the chain.",

It includes labeled functions for mapping, folding, filtering, and sorting, enhancing code clarity and flexibility, while safe variants prevent exceptions during element access, lookup, and splitting. Submodules enable list comparison and equality checks based on element ordering, and define standard operators like `@` for concatenation. Examples include safely finding an element by predicate, merging lists, comparing integer lists for order, or deduplicating based on custom logic.",
