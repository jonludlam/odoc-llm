      "description": "This module implements a weak hash table structure with standard operations including insertion, lookup, removal, and iteration, where keys are held weakly to allow garbage collection. It works with arbitrary key and value types, maintaining multiple bindings per key in a stack-like order. Concrete use cases include caching systems and memoization where keys must be automatically reclaimed when no longer referenced externally.",

      "description": "This module provides first-in-first-out operations for managing ordered collections, including element insertion, removal, traversal, and in-place transformations. It works with generic queues and supports conversions to and from enumerations and sequences, along with exception-safe variants for handling empty structures. Typical use cases involve processing data streams with strict order requirements, transferring elements between queues, or integrating with lazy evaluation pipelines through sequence conversions.",

It works with typed arrays of integers (16-64 bits), floating-point numbers (32/64-bit), and complex values, organized in 0D to 3D dimensions with configurable memory layouts. These capabilities are particularly useful for numerical computing, interfacing with C/Fortran libraries, and handling large datasets requiring precise memory representation.",

It works with result values that encapsulate outcomes of fallible operations, offering utilities to inspect, compare, convert them to options/lists/sequences, and chain workflows using monadic combinators or infix operators. It is particularly useful for structuring robust pipelines where failures need graceful handling, values require conditional extraction, or exceptions must be transformed into explicit error states.",
