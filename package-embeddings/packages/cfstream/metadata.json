It handles transformations with functions like `map`, `fold`, and `map2_exn`, ensuring errors are carried through computations. Use cases include parsing or validating sequences of data where each step may fail, such as reading and processing lines from a file with potential format errors.",

It handles infinite or large data sequences efficiently, with core operations for stream manipulation and consumption. The child modules enable converting structured data to and from streams, supporting incremental serialization and deserialization of records or collections. Use cases include line-by-line file parsing, streaming data conversion, and generating infinite mathematical sequences.",

It works with generic streams (`'a t`), character and string streams from input channels, and conversions to and from lists, arrays, hashtables, and sets, making it ideal for parsing, handling large datasets, and managing input streams with error recovery. The child modules enhance this functionality with numeric stream operations using infix operators, error propagation over streams of `Or_error.t`, and result-aware processing for streams of `Result` values. Examples include generating numeric sequences, reading and validating lines from a file, and aggregating results from fallible computations.",
