It supports transformations with functions like `map` and `fold`, and combines streams with `map2_exn`, propagating errors encountered during processing. Concrete use cases include parsing or validating sequences of data where each step may fail, such as reading and processing lines from a file with error handling.",

It works directly with stream data types, allowing concise inline manipulations such as creating sequences with specified increments or applying functions during traversal. Concrete use cases include generating numerical sequences, processing stream elements inline without function call syntax, and chaining transformations and filters in a readable, operator-based style.",

It works with streams of `Result.t` values, applying functions that either return a result or assume success, and propagating errors automatically. Concrete use cases include transforming streams of parsed values, aggregating results from sequential computations, and handling error-prone data streams without explicit pattern matching at each step.",

It operates on generic streams (`'a t`) and integrates with standard data structures like lists, arrays, and error-aware types (`Result.t`, `Or_error.t`), supporting indexed processing, parallel traversal, and stream fusion. These capabilities are used for tasks such as incremental data processing, I/O pipelines with on-demand evaluation, and error-resilient stream aggregation where elements are consumed sequentially.",
