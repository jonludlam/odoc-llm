      "description": "This module provides a minimal spreadsheet interface with row-based data manipulation, supporting creation, row addition, row counting, and file input/output. It integrates the RowSet module for managing row sets, enabling operations like adding, removing, and querying rows by unique identifiers, based on the `Spec.row` type that defines row structure. You can use it to handle structured data such as financial records or inventory lists, performing tasks like bulk updates or filtering visible rows. The combination of direct spreadsheet operations and row set management enables efficient and structured manipulation of tabular datasets.",

      "description": "This module implements a minimal functor for constructing and manipulating spreadsheets as collections of rows, abstracting over the row structure to support flexible data handling. It provides core operations for reading and writing spreadsheet data, while integrating submodules that define row structures as string lists and manage row sets for efficient data manipulation. Main data types include rows represented as lists of strings and row sets with identifier-based access, supporting operations like adding, removing, and transforming rows. Example uses include parsing and serializing CSV data, managing financial records with row identifiers, and performing bulk updates or filters on structured datasets.",
