It provides functions to merge patches into data, transform patches, map over data, and compute differences between data instances. It works with generic data types `'a data` and patch types `'a patch`, enabling precise updates and comparisons in reactive programming contexts.",

It supports data types like `'a t` for reactive containers, `'a handle` for mutable access, and `'a msg` for update messages, enabling precise incremental updates. Concrete use cases include building dynamic user interface elements that react to external data streams or user input events.",

It operates on reactive lists and their associated handles, enabling use cases such as interactive interfaces where elements are dynamically filtered or reordered based on user input, and data pipelines that automatically propagate changes to derived structures like computed aggregates or filtered subsets.",

It provides core operations to merge, transform, and map patches over generic data types, while submodules like RList and RMap offer list- and map-specific mutations such as insertions, removals, and reordering. You can build reactive user interfaces where elements dynamically filter or reorder based on input, or track real-time state changes in structured data like key-value configurations. Handles and signals allow mutable access and event-driven updates, enabling efficient propagation of changes across derived computations.",
