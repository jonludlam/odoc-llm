It works with reactive data structures that track modifications via signals and patches, enabling efficient updates in event-driven systems. Use cases include real-time data synchronization and dynamic interfaces where downstream dependencies must respond to incremental changes.",

It works with structured data where keys define order and values are polymorphic, enabling tasks like sorted data processing or dynamic associative storage. Use cases include maintaining ordered dictionaries, efficiently querying extrema, or applying custom transformations to hierarchical datasets.",
