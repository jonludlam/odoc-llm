      "description": "This module provides operations for dynamically managing lists that propagate incremental changes through reactive programming constructs. It works with a specialized list type that tracks modifications as patches, supporting transformations like mapping, filtering, and folding over changes, as well as structural updates such as insertion, removal, and reordering. Typical applications include data-driven user interfaces and real-time processing pipelines where list modifications must automatically update dependent computations or views.",

It provides operations to create, modify, and observe reactive containers, including functions to apply transformations, filter elements, and fold over updates. Concrete use cases include building dynamic user interfaces where data changes over time and propagating updates efficiently without recomputing entire structures.",

It provides operations to create, modify, and observe reactive containers using handles, signals, and events, including functions like `map`, `fold`, and `patch` for efficient transformations and state accumulation. Concrete use cases include building dynamic user interface components that update in response to data changes or processing streams of data updates in real-time.",
