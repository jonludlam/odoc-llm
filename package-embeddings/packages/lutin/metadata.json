      "description": "This module provides utilities for working with associative collections that use string keys and arbitrary values, enabling functional transformations like mapping, filtering, and folding. It supports conversions between maps and lists or sequences of key-value pairs, facilitating bulk updates and iterative processing. You can use it to manage configuration data, track dynamic key-value relationships, or implement memoization tables with string-based indexing. Operations include creating, transforming, and querying these collections directly or through submodules that extend its core functionality.",
