It provides constructors and accessors to create, inspect, and manipulate private keys in various formats encountered in SSH agent communication. Concrete use cases include parsing and serializing private keys for agent requests, handling certificate-based authentication, and managing key blobs for unsupported key types.",

It works directly with public and private key types, identity records, and structured protocol messages, enabling concrete use cases such as parsing and serializing keys for agent requests, handling certificate-based authentication, and managing key blobs for unsupported types. The module includes functionality to serialize and parse SSH agent messages using Faraday and Angstrom, allowing construction and decoding of binary protocol data for communication with the ssh-agent daemon. It also supports handling of certificate data such as validity periods, principals, and critical options, enabling full workflows for SSH key-based authentication and certificate signing and verification.",
