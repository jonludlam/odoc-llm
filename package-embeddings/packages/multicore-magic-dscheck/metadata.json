It supports creating arrays with initialized values, reading and writing elements without memory fences, and performing compare-and-set operations for synchronization in multicore environments. Use cases include implementing lock-free data structures and shared-state concurrency primitives where precise memory ordering is managed externally.",

It works with generic values wrapped in the `Transparent_atomic.t` type, including integers for arithmetic operations. Concrete use cases include implementing thread-safe counters, synchronization primitives, and low-level concurrent data structures where explicit control over memory ordering is required.",

It includes functions for copying values with padding, creating and inspecting padded arrays, and performing memory fence operations, alongside modules for thread-safe atomic variables and arrays with transparent memory ordering. Use cases include building custom synchronization primitives, thread-safe counters, and lock-free data structures requiring fine-grained control over concurrency and memory visibility.",
