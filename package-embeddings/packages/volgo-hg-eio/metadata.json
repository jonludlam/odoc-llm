It centers around the `t` type for runtime context, interacting directly with the file system and `hg` processes to manage repositories, track changes, and query history. Submodules handle specific tasks: `add` stages files, `commit` applies changes, `ls_files` lists tracked files, and `init` creates new repositories. It supports Eio-based applications needing direct Mercurial integration, such as tracking file states or inspecting revision history through structured CLI interactions.",
