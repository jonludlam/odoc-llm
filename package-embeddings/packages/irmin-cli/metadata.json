It works with Irmin store types that support keyed and hash-based operations, enabling concrete store instantiation from CLI parameters. Use it to resolve and construct specific Irmin store instances when building command-line interfaces for Irmin-based applications.",

It supports constructing stores with customizable hash functions and backends such as Git, filesystem, or pack stores, and allows registration of named constructors for dynamic instantiation. The module enables selecting remote connection functions for networked backends and provides utilities to resolve store types from CLI parameters. For example, it can instantiate a Git-backed store with a SHA256 hash or a filesystem store with a BLAKE2B hash through command-line flags.",

It integrates with a configuration module that resolves store backends, hash algorithms, and content types from CLI arguments and files, supporting dynamic selection of implementations like Git or SHA-256. Core data types include `store`, `hash`, and `contents`, with registries mapping named types to concrete implementations such as `Irmin.Contents.String`. Users can build and run custom CLI tools for tasks like inspecting versioned repositories, switching branches, or displaying store configurations.",
