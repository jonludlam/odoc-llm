It operates on 32-bit registers (`EBPF.reg`) within eBPF instructions (`EBPF.insn`), providing foundational capabilities for low-level program logic. These operations are essential for implementing network packet filtering, system monitoring, or custom kernel-space computations in eBPF programs.",

It operates on eBPF registers and immediate integer values, supporting 32-bit and 64-bit operations alongside byte-order conversions for kernel-level networking or tracing applications. Specific use cases include implementing packet filters, system call tracing, and performance monitoring tools requiring precise register-level control.",
