It constructs expressions and structure items for encoding and decoding values, primarily handling type declarations, extensions, and signature items. It is used to automatically derive encodings for types like records, variants, and polymorphic variants, enabling efficient binary or JSON serialization in applications such as network communication or data storage.",

It enables seamless conversion between sets, lists, and sequences, while preserving immutability, making it ideal for scenarios requiring symbolic analysis, configuration tracking, or data processing pipelines where shared set structures must remain unmodified.",

It provides utilities to define encodings with optional fields, default values, and custom transformations, while also handling advanced JSON schemas with polymorphic variants, recursive types, and metadata (titles, descriptions). Specific use cases include generating precise JSON representations for complex data models and defining named, reusable encoding schemas with declarative syntax.",

It includes functions for transforming string casing, extracting metadata from payloads, managing temporary variables, and building schema-aware encodings for tuples and records. The child module enables composition of data encodings for serializing and deserializing OCaml values, supporting primitives, structured data, and advanced JSON schemas with optional fields, polymorphic variants, and recursive types. Examples include generating JSON serializers for complex data models and injecting encoding logic into AST nodes using declarative, reusable schemas.",

It works directly with OCaml AST components to enable schema-driven code generation, supporting customization through parameters like field casing and optional field handling. The child module provides functional set operations over string collections, enabling non-destructive transformations, membership checks, and ordered iteration, which can be used alongside the core encoding functionality to manage symbolic configurations or analyze data schemas. Together, they support tasks like automated serialization, data transformation pipelines, and structured code generation where both encoding logic and set-based analysis are required.",
