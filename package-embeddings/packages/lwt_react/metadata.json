It operates on `React.signal` and `React.event` types, offering functions to merge, transform, and lift multi-argument computations (e.g., combining six boolean signals into a derived value via `l6`). Typical use cases include dynamic UIs where boolean state changes trigger updates or composing complex event-driven behaviors from multiple boolean inputs.",
