It works with event types like `note` and `controller`, which carry channel, parameter, and value fields. Concrete use cases include constructing and deconstructing MIDI events for music synthesis, handling real-time input from MIDI devices, and implementing custom MIDI processing logic.",

It operates on handles and parameter structures to manage audio formats, buffer sizes, and synchronization, while supporting both standard and Bigarray float arrays for efficient data handling. Designed for applications requiring direct ALSA interaction, it facilitates tasks such as real-time audio processing, low-latency streaming, and hardware-specific configuration.",

It creates and configures sequencer ports with specific capabilities and types, subscribes to input/output ports, and processes MIDI-like events such as note on/off, controller changes, and pitch bend. Used to build applications that interact directly with MIDI hardware or software, like synthesizers, MIDI controllers, or real-time music processors.",

It provides functions for retrieving ALSA version information, handling errors, and suppressing error output to stderr, working with exceptions and a custom direction type. The module's submodules enable precise PCM audio stream manipulation and ALSA sequencer MIDI event handling, supporting concrete use cases such as real-time audio processing, low-latency playback/capture, and MIDI device control.",
