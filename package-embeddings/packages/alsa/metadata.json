It supports configuration of hardware parameters like sampling rate, buffer size, and endianness, enabling real-time audio processing tasks and handling states such as underrun, overrun, and hardware suspension. Specific use cases include managing audio buffer underruns/overruns, tuning hardware parameters for optimal performance, and ensuring compatibility with varying bit-depth and endianness requirements.",

It handles pitch, velocity, and control change values, enabling manipulation of MIDI data for synthesis. Functions include creating, modifying, and querying events, allowing for dynamic score generation and real-time parameter adjustment. Examples include transposing notes, adjusting volume, and automating controller values across a sequence.",
