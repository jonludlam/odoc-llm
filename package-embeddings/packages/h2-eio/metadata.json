It enables handling incoming requests with custom logic, sending requests with support for streaming responses, and managing connection lifecycles with operations like ping, shutdown, and close detection. The module supports secure and plaintext transports, and handles advanced HTTP/2 features like server push and trailers. Example uses include building HTTP/2 servers that process requests over TLS and writing clients that send concurrent requests with streaming response handling.",
