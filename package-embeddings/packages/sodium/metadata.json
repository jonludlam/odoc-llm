It supports key generation, password-based key derivation, nonce manipulation, and constant-time key comparison, with direct use cases including encrypting data with a shared secret and managing sequential encrypted streams. The module's submodules extend this functionality by offering conversions between keys, nonces, and storage types, along with authenticated encryption and decryption operations. Together, they enable secure message transmission, cryptographic buffer management, and integrity-protected data storage.",

It provides core types like `hash`, `key`, and `storage` for handling fixed and variable-length digests, with operations for keyed and unkeyed hashing, streaming updates, and secure serialization. Submodules extend functionality to bigbytes, enable direct key and hash manipulation, and support use cases like message authentication, data integrity checks, and secure storage of hashed values. Examples include hashing a password with a salt, incrementally hashing a large file, or authenticating a message with a secret key.",

It supports public-key and secret-key cryptography, including encryption, signing, hashing, and authenticated encryption, with core types such as keys, nonces, signatures, and hashes. Operations include generating and verifying digital signatures, computing message authentication codes, deriving keys from passwords, and performing elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman exchanges, all with constant-time safety and secure memory handling. Submodules extend these capabilities with byte-level operations, serialization, and specialized algorithms like BLAKE2b and Argon2i, enabling tasks such as secure password storage, authenticated network messaging, and low-level protocol implementation.",
