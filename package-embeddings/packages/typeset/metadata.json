Operates on inductive data structures representing source code elements, such as expressions, statements, and type declarations. Used to generate compact, readable source code output by dynamically adjusting line breaks based on a specified width constraint.",

It works with internal representations such as abstract syntax trees and document objects, allowing for hierarchical nesting and operator-based combinations. Specific use cases include generating typeset outputs, dynamically adjusting layout structures, and creating reusable formatting patterns.",
