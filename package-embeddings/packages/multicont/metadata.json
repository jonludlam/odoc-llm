      "description": "This module extends OCaml's linear continuations with multi-shot capabilities, supporting both shallow and deep continuation manipulation. It offers data types representing resumable continuation states, with operations to promote, resume, abort, clone, and drop continuations. These features enable advanced control flow patterns such as coroutines, backtracking search, and context-aware exception handling with precise control over execution reinstatement. For example, a coroutine system can be built by cloning and resuming continuations at different points in the program's execution.",
