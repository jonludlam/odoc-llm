      "description": "This module implements the UCB1 algorithm for multi-armed bandit problems. It provides functions to select actions based on upper confidence bounds, update the bandit with rewards, track total rewards, and retrieve the best-performing arm using custom evaluation functions. It works with a state machine that enforces proper sequencing of actions and reward assignments, along with arm statistics tracking.",

It supports creating a bandit with an array of arms, selecting actions based on UCB1, updating the bandit with rewards, and retrieving statistics. Useful for reinforcement learning scenarios where exploration and exploitation must be balanced, such as in recommendation systems or online advertising.",

It works with an abstract type `t` representing individual arms, which correspond to actions in a decision-making process. Concrete use cases include selecting optimal actions in multi-armed bandit problems and implementing exploration-exploitation strategies in reinforcement learning.",

It centers around the `arm_statistics` type, tracking activation counts, cumulative rewards, and averages, and provides operations to select arms, apply rewards, and retrieve the best-performing arm. Submodules define arm interfaces, support custom arm types, and enforce state transitions for correct reward assignment. Example uses include recommendation systems and online advertising, where decisions must adapt based on partial feedback.",
