It enables efficient sorted access, key-range queries, and sequence conversions, optimized to avoid redundant data copying through physical equality checks. These capabilities are particularly useful for managing Redis cluster slot mappings, partitioning ordered data, and handling key-value sequences with precise range operations.",
