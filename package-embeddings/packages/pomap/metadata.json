It provides core abstractions for building custom storage layers, with support for typed indices, ordered maps, and sets to facilitate operations like insertion, deletion, lookup, and ordered traversal. Child modules extend this foundation with concrete implementations for index generation, map and set manipulations, and indexed collections, enabling tasks such as managing sparse identifier spaces, performing range queries, and transforming indexed data. Examples include maintaining sorted key-value stores, synchronizing data between maps and sequences, and implementing index-based grouping and filtering logic.",

It includes signatures for defining ordering logic and map behavior, supporting use cases such as dependency management and hierarchical data representation. Child modules provide concrete implementations for indexed maps with ordered keys, index manipulation, set operations, and structures for tracking and transforming partially ordered data relationships. Specific capabilities include efficient range queries, index generation, equivalence class computation, and topological traversal strategies over structured key-value stores.",

It includes functionality for generating textual or graphical output, particularly through DOT configurations, and works with partially ordered maps via the `pomap` type. Operations like `fprintf` and `printf` display hierarchical relationships, while configuration modules control layout, styling, and node attribute formatting. Example uses include debugging data structures and generating visualizations with custom orientations, labels, and visual attributes.",

It supports key data types such as partially ordered maps, indexed sets, and equivalence-classed collections, enabling operations like topological traversal, set algebra, and index-based transformations. Users can render Hasse diagrams with custom styling, perform efficient membership and range queries, and maintain ordered or partially ordered key-value associations. Example tasks include visualizing class hierarchies, managing dependency graphs, and processing ordered or partially ordered datasets with precise control over structure and display.",
