It provides core data types such as `commit`, `branch`, `path`, `hash`, and `contents`, with operations for building and inspecting Merkle trees, tracking version history, and managing metadata and structured keys. Submodules handle path manipulation, content addressing, commit graph traversal, and batched tree operations, enabling concrete tasks like creating versioned file systems, synchronizing collaborative documents, and generating cryptographic proofs. You can build commits with parent history, resolve conflicts in distributed stores, and apply complex tree modifications as atomic JSON transactions.",
