      "description": "This module offers operations for dynamically managing key-value pairs through hash tables, supporting insertion, deletion, lookup, and transformation with both imperative and functional paradigms. It works with generic table types featuring keys of type `ex`, enabling efficient manipulation via sequence-based creation (`of_seq`) and updates (`replace_seq`). Use cases include scenarios requiring mutable state management, such as compiler symbol tables or real-time data processing pipelines.",

Operates on values of any type and node structures that represent input sources.

Works with any type that supports the `t` functor interface, such as option, list, or custom effectful structures. Allows concise chaining of operations like binding a value to a function that returns a wrapped result or combining two wrapped values into a tuple.",

It supports variables with undo, streams that regenerate on change, monadic transformations, and hash tables with functional updates. Users can track state changes, build reactive pipelines, chain effectful computations, and manage mutable key-value structures. Examples include updating UI elements in real time, processing event-driven data, and maintaining symbol tables during compilation.",
