Works with float-based coordinates and rectangular regions to manage stored values efficiently. Used for querying points within specific geographic or spatial ranges, such as filtering locations inside a defined area.",

Works with a polymorphic tree type `'a t` that maps strings to values of type `'a`. Used to efficiently store and retrieve data based on string prefixes, such as in routing tables or autocomplete systems.",
