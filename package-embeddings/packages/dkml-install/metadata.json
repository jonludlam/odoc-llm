It operates directly on the internal state of the component registry, ensuring a clean slate for subsequent registrations. This function is used during testing or reinitialization scenarios where a fresh registry state is required.",

Works with component configurations that specify dependencies via `install_depends_on`, and uses a selector type to filter components for evaluation. Used to manage component lifecycles during installation or removal, ensuring proper ordering based on dependencies.",

It works with a custom `t` type representing forward progress states, alongside fatal loggers for error reporting, and integrates structured exit codes via the `Exit_code` submodule. Concrete use cases include orchestrating installation steps where partial failures require controlled exits with detailed diagnostics, and chaining subprocesses that must log errors consistently and halt on unrecoverable conditions.",
