It defines typed representations for GitHub resources such as pull requests, issues, milestones, labels, teams, repositories, commits, releases, and webhook events, along with metadata like user information, permissions, and activity timelines. These functions are specifically used for consuming and producing GitHub API requests/responses, handling tasks like parsing webhook payloads, constructing API update operations, and processing repository analytics or CI/CD pipeline data.",

It provides operations to transform raw JSON input into typed representations, enabling precise handling of event data. Users can leverage these transformations to implement automated workflows such as CI/CD triggers or synchronized issue tracking systems. For example, a JSON payload from a new issue event can be parsed into an `issue_created` type, allowing downstream logic to react appropriately.",
