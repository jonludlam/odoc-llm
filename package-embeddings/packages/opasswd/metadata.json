It supports operations such as retrieving records by name or iterating through the database, and includes mechanisms to lock the shadow file for safe concurrent access. The integrated serialization submodule enables conversion between in-memory representations and structured data formats, facilitating storage and transmission of shadow entries. Example uses include enforcing password expiration policies, managing user login restrictions, and synchronizing authentication data across systems.",
