It works with structured data such as message fields, binary/text content, and stream-based abstractions to facilitate client-server interactions. Use cases include building asynchronous HTTP clients, processing streamed data, and managing WebSocket connections within a functional programming framework.",

It works with character buffers, streams backed by strings, pipes, or custom reader/writer interfaces, and utilizes promises for asynchronous operations. Specific use cases include real-time communication protocols, network data processing, and scenarios requiring precise control over data transmission and closure.",
