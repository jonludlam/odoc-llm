      "description": "This module provides a domain-specific language for composing and executing shell-like commands, centered around the `cmd` type representing processes. It supports operations like piping, sequencing, and background execution, with combinators for transforming output line-by-line, manipulating files, and processing text in a Unix-like style. The child module adds infix operators for command composition, input/output redirection, and logical sequencing, enabling the construction of complex shell pipelines directly in OCaml. Examples include chaining `cmd` values with `|>` to process output, redirecting streams to files using `>` and `2>`, and running commands in parallel using background operators.",
