It works with the `cmd` type to model shell pipelines, supporting operations like input/output redirection, command sequencing, and logical control flow. Concrete use cases include building complex shell command chains with redirects and conditional execution directly in OCaml.",

      "description": "This module enables composing and executing shell-like pipelines using a domain-specific language, supporting operations like process piping, input/output redirection, and conditional command sequencing. It centers on a process representation type, working with strings, files, and environment settings through functions that mirror Unix utilities (e.g., `grep`, `ls`, `sed`) and advanced stream manipulation (e.g., line filtering, fuzzy finding with `fzf`). Typical use cases include building complex command chains programmatically, processing text streams with transformations, and automating system tasks with synchronous or asynchronous execution models.",
