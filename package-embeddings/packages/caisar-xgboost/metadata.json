      "description": "Provides methods to retrieve specific float values from a structured data representation, construct instances from parsed feature lists, and load multiple instances from file paths. Works with a custom type `t` that encapsulates parsed input data. Used to extract numerical values for processing and to initialize data structures from external sources like configuration files.",

      "description": "This module offers pretty-printing and string serialization for machine learning model configurations, along with JSON encoding/decoding capabilities for structured parameters like gradient boosting trees, loss functions, and learner settings. It operates on OCaml types such as `gbtree_model_param`, `tree`, `objective`, and `learner`, enabling seamless conversion to and from `Yojson.Safe.t` representations. These functions support use cases like model configuration validation, persistent storage, and debugging by providing human-readable outputs and interoperable data formats.",

It processes parsed data structures and input representations specific to the application's modeling pipeline. Used to transform model outputs into probabilities and evaluate input data against a trained system.",

It manages custom types for structured data, model parameters, and tree nodes, enabling operations like value extraction, pretty-printing, sigmoid transformation, and prediction evaluation. Functions support loading data from files, serializing model settings, and generating predictions from tree structures. Examples include converting model parameters to JSON, extracting float values for processing, and evaluating input data against a trained tree model.",
