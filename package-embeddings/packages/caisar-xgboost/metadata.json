      "description": "This module implements decision tree structures for gradient boosting models, supporting prediction operations on input data. It defines tree nodes as either splits based on feature values or leaf nodes with output scores, and applies transformations like the sigmoid function after summing leaf values. The primary use case is scoring input instances using an ensemble of trained decision trees.",

It defines a type `t` for input instances and provides functions to retrieve feature values by index, construct inputs from feature lists, and load inputs from files using a parser. It is used to prepare structured data for model training or inference tasks.",

It ensures type-safe conversions using `Yojson.Safe.t` and robust error handling via result types, targeting operations like model persistence, configuration inspection, and cross-system interoperability. Specific utilities support multiclass objectives, ranking models, and ensemble methods like DART, enabling seamless transitions between in-memory structures and JSON formats.",

It supports decision trees with feature-based splits and leaf scores, applies transformations like the sigmoid function to final outputs, and handles model serialization in JSON format. Users can load input data from feature lists or files, compute predictions, and inspect or persist model components with type-safe JSON conversions. Example usage includes scoring an input vector using an ensemble of trees or saving and loading trained models for deployment.",
