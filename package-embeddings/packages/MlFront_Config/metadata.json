Use cases include build systems extracting dependency metadata or remote content retrieval tools analyzing module references across OCaml projects.",

It provides operations to construct, compare, and manipulate these specifications, such as replacing ABI placeholders in mirror URLs and parsing from ocamldoc comments. Concrete use cases include configuring remote library retrieval with ABI-specific substitutions and handling multiple binary/library source locations.",
