It handles methods, headers, versions, and statuses, enabling interoperability between the two libraries when processing HTTP requests and responses. For example, it translates `Awsm.Http.Meth.t` to `Cohttp.Code.meth` and extracts HTTP headers from a `Cohttp.Response.t` into an `Awsm.Http.Headers.t`.",

It includes injection and projection functions to convert between deferred values and HTTP monadic actions, and constructs streams and HTTP clients for handling requests and responses. Concrete use cases include building asynchronous HTTP servers and clients that process requests and stream data in a non-blocking manner.",
