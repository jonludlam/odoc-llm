It supports issuing standard HTTP requests, inspecting response metadata like status codes and headers, and working with message bodies through both synchronous and streaming interfaces. Key data types include deferred values for asynchronous results, Cohttp response objects, and pipes for streaming large payloads. Examples include making REST API calls, processing HTTP responses incrementally, and building scalable HTTP clients and servers using Async I/O.",

It works with `Async.Deferred.t` values, supporting retries limited by a maximum count and backoff interval. The included HTTP conversion submodule enables seamless interoperability between Awsm and Cohttp by translating HTTP methods, headers, versions, and statuses. Use it to build resilient network clients that retry failed requests and interface with Cohttp-based services.",
