      "description": "This module establishes a comprehensive access control system that enables defining, enforcing, and persisting role-based authorization policies. It introduces core data types such as actors identified by UUIDs, target specifications, actions (`Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Manage`), and rules that combine actor, action, and target into enforceable policies. Operations include checking permissions, validating effects, assigning roles, and managing ownership, with support for asynchronous workflows and JSON serialization. You can use it to implement fine-grained access control in content management systems or multi-tenant platforms, persist and query actor roles, generate and manage UUIDs for distributed entities, and evaluate permissions dynamically using rule sets and validation logic.",
