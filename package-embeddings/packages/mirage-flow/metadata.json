It works with Cstruct.t buffers and lists of buffers, handling errors like end-of-file and closure. Concrete use cases include implementing network protocols over TCP or Unix sockets where precise control over data transmission and connection termination is required.",

      "description": "This module provides an interface for flow-based communication in MirageOS, centered around bidirectional data flows using Cstruct.t buffers. It supports reading, writing, and managing connection lifecycles, with error handling for conditions like end-of-file or closure. Operations allow precise control over data transmission, enabling implementations of network protocols over TCP or Unix sockets. Examples include managing connection states, serializing packets, and handling stream termination in TCP or TLS stacks.",
