It defines core operations for querying plugin properties like class, features, and ports, and supports instantiation and execution via its instance submodule. The class module enriches plugin organization with human-readable labels for functional types such as \"Delay\" or \"Reverb\". With this structure, developers can analyze plugin capabilities, group by category, and run audio processing tasks efficiently using connected float ports and real-time execution controls.",

It defines core data types such as `plugin`, `port`, `uri`, and `value`, along with operations to load plugins, connect ports, and manage plugin state. You can use it to build host applications that discover and instantiate LV2 plugins, query plugin metadata, and run plugins in a real-time audio context. Specific examples include enumerating plugin ports, setting port values, and handling LV2 extension features like presets and UIs.",
