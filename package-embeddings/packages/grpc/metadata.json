It supports direct conversion to bytes and strings, and provides precise control over buffer capacity and data positioning. Concrete use cases include parsing binary protocols, managing network data streams, and handling in-memory data transformations with strict performance requirements.",

It provides functions to process individual messages or all messages in a buffer, invoking a callback on each extracted message.

It provides functions to convert codes to and from integers, format them as strings, and construct or inspect status values with optional messages. These features are used to create, manipulate, and extract gRPC status values, particularly from HTTP/2 headers during RPC call handling.",
