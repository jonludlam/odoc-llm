      "description": "This module defines core operations for handling HTTP requests and responses within a RESTful framework. It provides functions like `continue` and `respond` to control request processing flow, and `to_handler` and `dispatch` to route and process requests based on predefined resource paths. It works with data types such as `auth`, `www_authenticate`, and Cohttp's request and response structures, enabling fine-grained control over authentication, response generation, and request routing. Use cases include implementing custom resource handlers, enforcing authentication challenges, and building composable HTTP services with structured routing logic.",

It works with Cohttp requests and responses, using records to track state such as headers, path parameters, and redirection flags. Concrete use cases include extracting path variables from RESTful routes, modifying response headers for content negotiation, and initiating redirects with the `redirect` function.",

It provides operations like `continue`, `respond`, and `dispatch` to manage request flow and routing, working with Cohttp's request and response types along with authentication and header manipulation features from its submodules. Developers can define custom resource behavior for HTTP methods, extract path variables, enforce authentication, and initiate redirects using structured routing and composable handlers. The module also supports asynchronous processing through monadic operations and includes a time abstraction for timestamping and testing.",
