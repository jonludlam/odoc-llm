It operates on data types such as `www_authenticate`, `auth`, and tuples representing HTTP responses, working directly with Cohttp's request and response structures. Concrete use cases include implementing custom resource handlers, enforcing authentication challenges, and dispatching requests to appropriate resources based on URI paths.",
