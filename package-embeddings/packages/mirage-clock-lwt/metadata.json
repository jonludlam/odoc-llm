It provides two main interfaces: one for measuring elapsed time in nanoseconds and determining clock period, and another for retrieving high-resolution timestamps in days and picoseconds since the epoch, with time zone and clock period support. Key operations include timing intervals for network tasks, timestamping events in distributed systems, and synchronizing operations across virtualized or embedded environments.",
