Works with custom data types for time intervals and timestamps, tailored for precise timing in network and system applications. Used to synchronize events in untrusted environments and measure elapsed time in MirageOS-based projects.",

Works with Lwt-based asynchronous operations and a unit type representing the clock interface. Used to synchronize applications with system time, handle time zone adjustments, and manage clock drift in networked or embedded systems.",
