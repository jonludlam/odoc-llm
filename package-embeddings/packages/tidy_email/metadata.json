It supports building emails with text, HTML, or mixed content bodies, and captures sent emails in a mutable list for inspection. You can create emails with structured recipients and subjects, then verify which emails were sent during tests. For example, you can construct a multi-part email to multiple recipients and later check that it was correctly added to the sent list.",
