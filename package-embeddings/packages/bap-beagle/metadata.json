      "description": "This module tracks sequences of characters observed during program emulation, associating them with the terms that produced or consumed those characters. It supports creating, detecting, and catching these sequences, along with tagging mechanisms for dynamic and static string sets. The child module handles efficient serialization, comparison, and manipulation of string sets, enabling storage, transmission, and analysis of unique word collections. Together, they allow precise behavioral analysis by correlating execution traces with character output, such as extracting command-line arguments or network payloads.",
