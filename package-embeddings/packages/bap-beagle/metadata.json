It provides comparison, S-expression conversion, and pretty-printing capabilities for string sets. Concrete use cases include persisting string sets to disk, transmitting them over a network, or converting them to human-readable representations for debugging.",

It supports operations to create and inspect prey instances, observe detection and capture events, and serialize string sets. Concrete use cases include analyzing emulated execution traces to extract and persist character sequences, and generating word sets from observed characters for further analysis.",
