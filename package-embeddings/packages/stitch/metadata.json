You can define a binary mathematical operation with explicit input and output types, wrap its result with JSON encoders and decoders, and serialize the arguments for transmission or storage. Another use case involves building API response handlers that consistently include metadata alongside structured data payloads.",

It supports operations on tuples of input types `'a * 'b` or `'a * 'b * 'c` with a return type `'ret`, enabling use cases like generating test cases for arithmetic or string operations based on external specifications. The configuration submodule provides `make` and `from_env` to control recording behavior via environment variables or explicit paths, while the signature module enables strongly-typed function definitions with JSON serialization, supporting structured return values and type-safe interactions across components. Example workflows include automatically creating and verifying functions from specifications, serializing arguments for transmission, or building API handlers with consistent metadata and payload structures.",
