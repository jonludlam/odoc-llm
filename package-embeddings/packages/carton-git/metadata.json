It operates on file paths (`Fpath.t`) and file descriptors, supporting asynchronous I/O operations like `map` for memory-mapped file access and `create` for initializing new object files. Concrete use cases include direct on-disk storage and retrieval of Git commit, tree, and blob objects during repository operations.",

It provides functions to create a Git store, add objects with indexing, fetch objects by UID, list stored objects, and access file descriptors associated with stored objects. It works with file paths (Fpath.t), Unix file descriptors (Lwt_unix.file_descr), and a user-defined UID type, handling low-level interactions with the filesystem and Git object encoding.",

It operates on file paths (`Fpath.t`), file descriptors (`Lwt_unix.file_descr`), and UIDs, supporting memory-mapped access, object indexing, and direct filesystem interaction. You can use it to store and fetch Git commits, trees, and blobs by UID, or list all stored objects. Example operations include initializing a new object file, memory-mapping a blob for efficient access, or fetching a commit by its hash.",
