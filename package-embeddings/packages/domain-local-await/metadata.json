It defines a thread type `t` and exposes functions to retrieve the current thread (`self`) and obtain a unique integer identifier for a thread (`id`). These operations enable tracking and synchronization of thread execution state in scheduler-agnostic concurrent libraries.",

      "description": "This module enables scheduler-friendly thread suspension and resumption through a low-level `t` type encapsulating `await` and `release` operations for one-time synchronization. It supports cooperative multitasking and async I/O by letting schedulers install efficient implementations via domain-local storage, while its child module tracks thread identities with `self` and `id` to coordinate execution state across concurrent libraries. Direct use of `prepare_for_await` allows libraries to block and resume threads portably, and `using` wraps scheduler loops to integrate optimized implementations seamlessly. Example applications include custom async frameworks and scheduler-agnostic concurrency primitives that interoperate efficiently with domain and thread-based execution models.",
