It works with domains and optionally threads, storing scheduler-specific implementations in domain or thread-local variables to ensure efficient, scheduler-friendly blocking. Concrete use cases include implementing cooperative concurrency libraries, such as async/await frameworks or event-driven systems, where precise control over suspension and resumption is required.",
