      "description": "This module defines interfaces for writing trace data with support for destination handling, argument serialization, and timestamp translation. It works with trace events, timestamps, and writer configurations, enabling custom trace backends and timestamp transformations. Main data types include writer state (`t`), interned string and thread IDs, event types like durations and counters, and precomputed headers. Operations allow precise time-to-tick conversion, low-level trace construction, typed argument writing, and efficient buffer management for performance-critical tracing scenarios.",

      "description": "This module manages trace data output by writing to Iobufs with support for strict and dynamic buffering, along with a black hole option for discarding traces. It coordinates trace event routing during logging or benchmarking and enables use cases like in-memory capture, streaming to pre-allocated storage, and trace suppression. A child module holds events until a destination is assigned, then replays buffered data and forwards new events, ensuring safe handling during shutdown. Together, they allow deferred configuration of trace outputs while maintaining visibility from early initialization stages.",

It provides low-level writing primitives for direct buffer manipulation alongside typed event definitions that enforce correctness through phantom types, supporting both high-performance and type-safe tracing workflows. With operations like `write_from_header_with_tsc` for time-stamped event writing and `set_string_slot` for interned string management, it allows detailed control flow and async task visualization in performance tools. Submodules handle identifier mapping, argument specification, and typed event construction, enabling use cases such as tracking thread activity with compact 8-bit IDs and writing structured event metadata with guaranteed argument consistency.",
