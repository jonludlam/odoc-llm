      "description": "This module bridges immutable array sequences with mutable structures, enabling indexed transformations, element manipulation, and sequence processing through safe and unsafe operations. It supports data types like `tFront`, `tBack`, and `tIndexed` for precise control over sequence ends and positions, with core operations including mapping, filtering, and reduction. Submodules provide mutable array handling via `get` and `set`, allowing in-place updates with or without bounds checking, ideal for tasks like buffer management and numerical algorithms. Examples include safely accessing or modifying elements in a data stream, implementing parser workflows with controlled error handling, and optimizing performance-critical sections with direct array mutation.",

It supports operations like `addFirst`, `removeLastExn`, and `reverse`, maintaining internal balance for efficient access. Use cases include managing sequences of elements where frequent insertions and deletions occur at both ends, such as in sliding window algorithms or real-time data processing pipelines.",

Core data types include mutable and immutable arrays, lists, deques, and optional values, with operations optimized for indexed access, dynamic resizing, and in-place modification. You can perform power-of-two calculations for buffer sizing, manipulate sequences with safe and unsafe indexing, extract timing features from rhythmic events, and implement custom binary searches over ordered data. Specific applications include real-time rhythm processing, musical synchronization, dynamic buffer management, and structured data transformation with error-safe pipelines.",
