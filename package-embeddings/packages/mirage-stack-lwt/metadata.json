Operates on IP addresses, buffers, and custom error types, with a callback system for processing received data. Used to manage network interactions where precise control over packet delivery and reception is required.",

It operates on TCP flows, IP addresses, ports, buffers, and connection states to facilitate data transmission and flow control. Use cases include server applications requiring reliable communication and managing persistent connections with timeout adjustments.",

It handles IP addresses, buffers, and connection states, supporting operations like sending datagrams, establishing TCP flows, and generating checksums. Functions include setting TTL, configuring keepalives, and processing incoming traffic based on port and protocol. Examples include building custom network protocols, implementing servers with reliable TCP streams, and routing IP packets with specific options.",
