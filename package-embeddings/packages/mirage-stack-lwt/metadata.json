      "description": "This module handles IPv4 networking operations, including sending and receiving IP packets, managing IP addresses, and calculating checksum pseudoheaders. It provides functions for demultiplexing incoming packets based on protocol, writing outgoing packets with configurable options like fragmentation and TTL, and retrieving interface configuration such as the MTU and assigned IP address. Concrete use cases include implementing custom network protocols over IPv4, handling raw IP communication in MirageOS unikernels, and managing low-level network interfaces.",

It works with IPv4 addresses, UDP sockets, and raw buffers, enabling direct interaction with network devices. Concrete use cases include implementing custom DNS resolvers, DHCP clients, or lightweight UDP-based protocols with per-packet routing and error handling.",

It works with IPv4 addresses, TCP flows, and buffers, supporting both standard and nodelay write modes. Concrete use cases include building network servers that handle incoming TCP connections and clients that communicate over IPv4 with reliable stream transport.",

      "description": "This module provides a network stack interface for IPv4 operations, enabling packet transmission, route management, and ARP handling across virtual and physical network interfaces. It supports direct manipulation of Ethernet frames, IP packets, and transport-layer protocols, with core operations for binding ports, demultiplexing traffic, and configuring addresses. The module facilitates building network servers, custom protocol implementations, and virtual switches by combining low-level packet control with high-level connection management. Use cases include routing IP packets in unikernels, implementing UDP-based services like DNS, and managing TCP flows for reliable communication.",
