It supports both input conversions (e.g., from microseconds or seconds) and output conversions (e.g., to milliseconds or minutes), ensuring accuracy for large values up to 584 years. Use cases include high-precision time calculations in systems requiring strict unit consistency, such as scientific simulations or real-time scheduling.",
