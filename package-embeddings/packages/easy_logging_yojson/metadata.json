It supports conversion between log levels and strings or JSON, enabling configuration parsing and log serialization. You can use it to create structured logs, adjust verbosity based on string-defined levels, and output logs in JSON format. For example, a log entry can be built with a severity level, timestamp, and custom tags, then converted to JSON for storage or transmission.",

It supports console, file, and rotating file outputs, allowing configuration through `Yojson.Safe.t` for dynamic reloading and structured log aggregation. The file management submodule handles log creation, rotation based on size or time, and channel setup, using date-prefixed filenames and backup policies. Together, they enable applications like automated log rotation pipelines and runtime configuration updates from JSON files.",

It defines core types like `level`, `log_item`, and handler configurations, enabling precise control over log formatting, filtering, and destination routing. Users can create loggers with custom severity thresholds, serialize logs to JSON, and manage outputs to console, files, or rotating logs based on size or time. Example uses include loading logging settings from JSON, generating timestamped log entries with custom tags, and setting up automatic log rotation with backup retention.",
