It operates on configuration objects specifying parameters like file paths, rotation thresholds (max size, backup count), and severity filters, which can be serialized to or deserialized from JSON for dynamic setup or persistent storage. These features enable use cases such as centralized log management, environment-specific logging pipelines, and runtime configuration updates via JSON files.",
