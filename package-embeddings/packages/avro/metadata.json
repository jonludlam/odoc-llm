It supports operations to register custom compression and decompression functions, look up codecs by name, and retrieve the name of a codec. The primary data type is `t`, representing a compression codec, with built-in support for \"null\" and \"deflate\" codecs.",

It works with a decoder type that tracks input state and uses a custom row-reading function to parse individual records. Concrete use cases include processing large Avro files incrementally, aggregating statistics from Avro-encoded logs, and streaming Avro data into memory-efficient structures.",

It works with Avro schemas, custom row types, and output targets like files or buffers, using a provided write function for serialization.

It provides operations for reading and writing Avro-encoded data blocks, managing compression codecs, and converting between in-memory row representations and their serialized form. Concrete use cases include persisting structured data to Avro files on disk, compressing and decompressing data blocks during transmission, and streaming large datasets without loading the entire file into memory.",
