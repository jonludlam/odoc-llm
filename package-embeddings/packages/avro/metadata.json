It includes transparent decompression for zlib-compressed data and works with byte sequences for low-level parsing of binary Avro structures. Submodules offer fine-grained control over buffer manipulation and byte extraction, enabling tasks like decoding Avro primitives from a stream or deserializing complex data from a network socket. Example uses include reading a varint-encoded integer from a file or parsing a sequence of Avro records from a compressed buffer.",

It supports streaming reads and writes with customizable serialization, compression using built-in or user-defined codecs, and memory-efficient block processing. You can write large datasets to disk incrementally, compress them with deflate or custom methods, and read them back row-by-row without loading the entire file. Examples include exporting log streams to Avro files and processing large datasets in a memory-constrained environment.",
