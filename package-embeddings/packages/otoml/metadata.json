It operates on TOML abstract syntax trees and provides flexible error handling through optional values, exceptions, or explicit result types, with configurable type coercion for numeric and datetime conversions. These functions are particularly useful for robustly accessing nested configuration values where missing data or format mismatches require precise recovery strategies.",
