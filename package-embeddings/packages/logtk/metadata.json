      "description": "<think> Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a 2-3 sentence description of the OCaml module based on the provided chunk summaries. The main points to cover are the main operations, the data structures they work with, and specific use cases. First, looking at the summaries. The module is about ordered maps. The first chunk mentions creating, modifying, querying, traversing maps with key-value pairs, and operations like adding/removing keys, checking membership, merging, folding, filtering, comparing. It also mentions customizable key ordering. So the main operations here are creation, modification, querying, traversal, merging, folding, filtering, and comparison. The data structures are ordered maps with key-value pairs. The keys and values can be of arbitrary types. The second chunk talks about querying, transforming, iterating, with unsafe and safe variants. Also, ordered traversal and predicate-based searches. The third chunk mentions constructing, combining, iterating, handling duplicates by merging values with a provided function. They work with sequences, lists, iterators. So the data structures are ordered maps, key-value pairs, and they handle arbitrary types. The use cases would include scenarios where you need to manage key-value data with ordered operations, like configuration settings, databases, or any application requiring ordered data with efficient lookups and transformations. Need to make sure not to use generic phrases. Avoid saying \"module Map\" again. Mention specific operations: adding/removing keys, merging, folding, filtering. Data structures: ordered maps with arbitrary key and value types, sequences, lists. Use cases: managing configuration data, processing structured datasets, efficient lookups and transformations. Check if the sentences are concise. Combine the elements into 2-3 sentences. Let me draft: This module provides operations for creating, modifying, and querying ordered maps with customizable key ordering, supporting functions like adding/removing keys, merging, folding, and filtering. It works with key-value pairs of arbitrary types and offers both safe and unsafe variants for operations, enabling efficient traversal and transformation of structured data. Use cases include managing configuration settings, processing datasets, and handling duplicate keys through value-merging strategies. Wait, the third chunk mentions handling duplicates by merging values with a provided function. So maybe include that in the use cases. Also, mention sequences, lists, iterators as data structures? The second chunk mentions sequences, lists, iterators. But the main data structure is ordered maps. Maybe mention that the functions work with sequences, lists, and iterators for iteration. But the user said to specify data structures or types. So maybe: \"operating on ordered maps with arbitrary key and value types, as well as sequences, lists, and iterators for traversal.\" But need to check if that's accurate. The third chunk says \"work with sequences, lists, and iterators\". So the module's functions operate on maps and also work with those structures. So maybe include that. But the main data structure is the ordered map. So perhaps: \"operating on ordered maps with arbitrary key and value types, and supporting sequences, lists, and iterators for traversal and transformation.\" Then use cases: managing configuration data, processing structured datasets, or applications requiring ordered key-value operations with duplicate handling. Putting it all together: This module provides operations for creating, modifying, and querying ordered maps with customizable key ordering, including adding/removing keys, merging, folding, and filtering. It operates on key-value pairs of arbitrary types and supports sequences, lists, and iterators for traversal, offering both safe and unsafe variants for operations. Use cases include managing configuration settings, processing structured datasets, and handling duplicate keys through value-merging strategies. That's three sentences. Maybe combine into two. Let me check the example given in the problem. The user's example response is two sentences. Let me see: The example response is: This module provides operations for creating, modifying, and querying ordered maps with customizable key ordering, including adding/removing keys, merging, folding, and filtering. It operates on key-value pairs of arbitrary types and supports sequences, lists, and iterators for traversal, offering both safe and unsafe variants for operations. Use cases include managing configuration settings, processing structured datasets, and handling duplicate keys through value-merging strategies. Wait, that's three sentences. But the user said 2-3. So maybe acceptable. But perhaps the user wants two. Let me check the original instruction again. The user says 2-3 sentences. So three is okay. But maybe the assistant can make it two. Let me try: This module provides operations for creating, modifying, and querying ordered maps with customizable key ordering, including adding/removing keys, merging, folding, and filtering. It operates on key-value pairs of arbitrary types, supports sequences, lists, and iterators for traversal, and offers safe and unsafe variants for operations, with use cases in managing configuration settings, processing structured datasets, and handling duplicate keys through value-merging strategies. That's two sentences. But maybe the user prefers three. Either way, as long as it's",

It provides core operations like arithmetic, set and map manipulations, substitution, unification, and pretty-printing, along with specialized functions for theorem proving, such as skolemization, clause normalization, and subsumption checks. Key data types include terms, clauses, sets, maps, and environments, with examples like converting TPTP problems to CNF, managing variable bindings, and generating human-readable output for debugging.",

It handles data aggregation, proof validation, format conversion, logical verification, and symbolic computation. Users can track proof dependencies, validate steps, integrate proofs, check formula entailment, and manipulate linear expressions. Examples include visualizing proof graphs, validating step-by-step deductions, converting proof formats, checking logical implications, and simplifying algebraic expressions.",
