      "description": "This module provides operations for command parsing, structured data navigation, persistent state management, syntax-directed editing, and XML tree manipulation. It works with string lists, recursive XML node types, token streams, source views, and UI components, supporting use cases like multi-mode code editing (OCaml/Makefile), user preference persistence, XML configuration generation, and interactive GUI layout control. Key patterns include abstract data traversal, mode-specific syntax handling, and declarative UI customization.",
