Operates on integers and byte arrays, supporting variable-length bit fields. Used to serialize structured data for network transmission or file storage.",

It enables low-level binary arithmetic and transformation, suitable for applications like data serialization, network protocol handling, or error detection algorithms requiring precise bit-level control. Specific functions facilitate tasks such as converting binary data to ASCII representations or analyzing bit patterns in cryptographic operations.",
