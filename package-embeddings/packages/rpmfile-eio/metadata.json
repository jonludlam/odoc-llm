      "description": "This module provides low-level parsing primitives and buffer management for processing byte streams and structured data, including functions to read binary values (e.g., uint8), parse sequences, and handle errors during input consumption. It operates on data structures like buffers, strings, and input flows, supporting composable parser combinators to build complex parsing workflows. These capabilities are tailored for tasks such as extracting RPM package headers, validating binary metadata, and ensuring strict correctness in data transformation pipelines.",

It provides functions to extract structured data such as package leads, header indices, null-terminated strings, and header entry values at specific offsets. These parsers support selective metadata extraction based on tag filters, enabling precise consumption of RPM headers and signatures from binary package files.",
