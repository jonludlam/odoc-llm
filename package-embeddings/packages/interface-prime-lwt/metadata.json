It includes operations to convert exceptions into error values, enabling robust error handling in asynchronous computations. Concrete use cases include composing Lwt-based operations that may fail, such as file I/O or network requests, where errors need to be explicitly handled or chained.",

It provides functions to read exact amounts of data, read available data, and manage channel closures, working with input and output channels that support byte, string, int32, and int64 types. It is suitable for network communication or file I/O where asynchronous behavior is required.",

      "description": "This module implements a monadic interface for handling computations that may fail, using the `E` type to represent errors and providing standard operations like `bind`, `return`, and `fmap` along with infix operators for chaining and transforming values. It supports lifting of optional values and integration with other monads through `lift`, enabling seamless composition of error-prone operations. The child module extends this functionality to asynchronous contexts, allowing conversion of exceptions into error values and facilitating robust error handling in Lwt-based workflows such as file I/O or network requests. Together, they enable concise, composable pipelines that handle success and failure cases explicitly and propagate errors cleanly through nested or sequential operations.",

      "description": "This module provides a comprehensive interface for asynchronous programming with Lwt, combining non-blocking I/O operations, monadic composition, and error handling. It supports reading and writing binary data asynchronously, sequencing deferred actions with bind and return, and handling failures cleanly using an error monad integrated with Lwt. You can use it to implement network clients and servers, process binary files asynchronously, or build pipelines that handle success and failure cases explicitly. For example, you can read a precise number of bytes from a socket, transform the result, and chain further operations all within a single deferred computation.",
