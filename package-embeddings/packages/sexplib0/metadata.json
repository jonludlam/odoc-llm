It works directly with `Sexplib0.Sexp.t` and `Stdlib.Buffer.t`, along with string manipulation utilities. It is used internally to implement functions like `to_buffer`, `to_buffer_hum`, and `to_buffer_mach`, which are essential for pretty-printing, machine-readable output, and size calculation of S-expressions.",

It provides utilities to define grammars for structured data interchange, handle tagged values, and register exception converters for precise error reporting during parsing. Typical applications include configuration file parsing, persistent data storage, and inter-process communication where typed data needs canonical textual representations.",
