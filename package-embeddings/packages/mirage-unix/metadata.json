It works with `float`, `int64`, and custom time types such as `span` and `t`. Concrete use cases include timing operations, implementing delays, and converting between seconds, milliseconds, and nanoseconds.",

Works with Lwt threads and domain lifecycle events, allowing callers to specify supported shutdown modes like poweroff or reboot. Useful for coordinating graceful shutdowns in server applications or virtual machine monitors.",

Works with Lwt threads and Unix-specific system resources like file descriptors, network interfaces, and process signals. Used to launch and manage the lifecycle of a Unix-based MirageOS application, including handling command-line arguments and system interrupts.",

It provides lifecycle management with controlled shutdown handling, a main entry point for application execution and event loop initialization, and precise time measurement and conversion functions. It is used to build self-contained Unix-based MirageOS applications that can manage time, respond to system signals, and coordinate clean termination.",
