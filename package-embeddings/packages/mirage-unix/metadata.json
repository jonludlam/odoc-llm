It works with Lwt threads and returns a variant type indicating the requested shutdown action. Concrete use cases include handling graceful shutdowns in server applications or virtualized environments where MirageOS runs as a unikernel.",

It offers a variant type to represent shutdown actions, functions to retrieve time and sleep with nanosecond precision, and a `run` function to launch and manage Lwt-based applications. You can use it to gracefully shut down a server, schedule timed events, or start a unikernel with Unix runtime support.",
