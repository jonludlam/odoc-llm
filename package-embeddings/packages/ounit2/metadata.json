It centers around test suites and execution contexts, enabling precise control over test parameters through command-line arguments, environment variables, and configuration files. Key data types include test cases, configurations, and custom logging handlers, while operations allow for defining assertions, capturing exceptions, and managing temporary resources. You can use it to write configurable, resource-aware test suites that adapt to different environments and integrate with custom command-line interfaces.",
