It supports operations to load fonts, generate glyph bitmaps, and calculate text metrics using types like font, glyph, and metric structures. Submodules provide axis-aligned bounding boxes for 2D regions, vertical and horizontal metrics for precise text layout, and byte buffers for GPU data operations. Examples include rendering scaled glyph bitmaps, computing line spacing with ascent and descent values, and uploading texture data via byte buffers.",

It integrates font rendering and layout computation through its submodules, offering direct access to JavaScript canvas contexts and low-level font manipulation with support for glyph generation and text metrics. Concrete operations include configuring font styles on a canvas, calculating line spacing using vertical metrics, and transferring glyph data to GPU buffers. The combination of high-level interface definitions and low-level rendering capabilities enables robust text handling in JavaScript-OCaml interop scenarios.",
