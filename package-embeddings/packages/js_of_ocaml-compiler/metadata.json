      "description": "This module provides the `assume_no_perform` function, which optimizes performance by forcing the direct-style execution of a given function, avoiding the overhead of the CPS transformation when effects are used. It works with functions of type `unit -> 'a`, ensuring that effect handlers are not preserved during execution, leading to potential `Effect.Unhandled` exceptions if effects are performed inside the function. Use this when performance is critical and the function is guaranteed not to perform any effects, such as in tight loops or low-level operations where effect handling is unnecessary.",
