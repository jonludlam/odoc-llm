      "description": "This module provides numerical solvers for initial value problems of ordinary differential equations, including functions for solving stiff and nonstiff systems with adaptive time-stepping and optional root-finding capabilities. It operates on vector and matrix types represented as Bigarrays, supporting dense and banded Jacobian matrices, and allows specifying tolerances, integration intervals, and custom Jacobian evaluation routines. Concrete use cases include simulating physical systems governed by ODEs, such as mechanical dynamics or chemical reactions, where high precision and performance are required.",
