It provides functions to convert between this virtual address and byte offsets using cluster bits, enabling precise addressing within the image file. Use cases include disk image parsing, virtual machine snapshot management, and efficient storage allocation tracking.",

      "description": "This module manages qcow image metadata, coordinating cluster-level operations such as reading, writing, and locking, while maintaining reference counts and mapping physical clusters. It provides core types like clusters, lock clients, and caches, with operations for atomic updates, usage tracking, and concurrency control through client-specific locks. The refcount submodule manipulates individual reference count values within clusters, enabling precise management of shared storage, while the physical address submodule interprets clusters as sequences of 64-bit pointers, allowing direct manipulation of level 2 cluster entries in qcow2 images. Together, these components support tasks like updating disk image contents atomically, managing cluster allocation, and navigating physical storage structures efficiently.",
