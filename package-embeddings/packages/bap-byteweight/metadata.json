It supports training on corpus data, serializing models, and folding over trie-based byte chunks to compute aggregate metrics or locate sequences matching specific conditions. The trie-based approach enables efficient exploration of byte n-gram distributions, making it suitable for reverse engineering tasks where distinguishing code from data in stripped binaries is critical.",
