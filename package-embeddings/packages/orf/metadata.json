      "description": "This module implements training, prediction, and evaluation workflows for classification tasks using decision forests, leveraging metrics like Gini impurity, ROC-AUC, and Matthews correlation coefficient. It operates on arrays of feature vectors and class labels, supporting model serialization, feature importance analysis, cost-driven data partitioning, and parallelized computation to optimize scalability for large datasets. Use cases include binary and multi-class classification, where non-constant feature selection, accuracy assessment, and efficient numeric conversion are critical for model performance.",

      "description": "This module implements a parallelized random forest regression algorithm with support for mean squared error, mean absolute error, and median absolute deviation metrics. It operates on feature vectors represented as integer arrays paired with floating-point dependent variables, organizing trained trees into a forest structure that supports out-of-bag prediction and model evaluation via the coefficient of determination (R\u00b2). Concrete use cases include training ensembles on large numerical datasets, making predictions with uncertainty estimates, and persisting models to disk for later deployment.",

It supports operations to retrieve and update feature values, iterate over all features, and initialize a zero vector. It is suitable for applications like machine learning feature engineering, where numerical features are dynamically managed in a vectorized format.",

      "description": "This module provides tools for building and evaluating decision forest models for classification and regression tasks, using efficient data structures and parallel computation. It supports key operations such as training models with feature selection, making predictions, evaluating performance using metrics like Gini impurity and R\u00b2, and serializing models for deployment. The core data types include feature vectors, forests of decision trees, and evaluation metrics, enabling workflows such as training a classifier on a labeled dataset, assessing its accuracy with cross-validation, or performing regression analysis on large numerical inputs. Example use cases include binary classification of tabular data, feature importance analysis, and scalable training of regression forests on high-dimensional datasets.",
