It provides operations to retrieve and set feature values, iterate over features, and create an empty feature vector. It is used to represent sparse feature vectors in machine learning tasks, where each feature corresponds to an integer index and a numeric value.",

      "description": "This module offers tools for constructing and evaluating random forest classifiers, processing feature vectors and class labels through training, prediction (including margin analysis), and performance metrics like accuracy, MCC, and ROC AUC. It enables advanced capabilities such as parallelized training, out-of-bag validation, feature selection, and serialization, while also handling numerical transformations, cost-based partitioning of data, and parallel array operations. These features support use cases ranging from high-dimensional classification to optimizing imbalanced datasets via cost-sensitive learning and efficient large-scale model deployment.",

      "description": "This module implements a parallelized random forest regression algorithm with support for mean squared error, mean absolute error, and median absolute deviation metrics. It operates on feature vectors represented as integer arrays paired with floating-point dependent variables, organizing decision trees in a forest structure that tracks out-of-bag samples for internal validation. It trains models using configurable numbers of trees, features, and thread cores, then supports prediction with uncertainty estimation, model evaluation via R\u00b2 scoring, and serialization for model persistence.",
