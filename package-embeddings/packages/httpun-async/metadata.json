Works with sockets and request handlers, enabling serving encrypted HTTP traffic with certificate and key files. Useful for implementing secure web servers that require SSL termination and per-connection request processing.",

It operates on SSL-wrapped socket connections and handles HTTP requests and responses through deferred I/O operations. Concrete use cases include making secure HTTP requests over established or default sockets, managing connection shutdown, and integrating with custom SSL implementations for secure communication.",

      "description": "This module manages asynchronous HTTP and HTTPS servers, routing incoming requests to custom handlers while leveraging Async for non-blocking, concurrent execution. It supports socket address configuration, SSL/TLS encryption via child module integration, and deferred processing of client connections. Primary data types include socket addresses, request handlers, and SSL configurations, with operations for binding sockets, handling HTTP(S) transactions, and managing secure connections. Example usage includes building a secure web server that serves encrypted traffic using provided certificate files and custom routing logic for each incoming request.",

      "description": "This module provides asynchronous HTTP client functionality over sockets, supporting connection creation, request submission with custom handlers, and lifecycle management through deferred I/O. It handles both standard and streaming HTTP/1.1 requests over TCP or SSL, with support for protocol upgrades like WebSockets. The SSL submodule extends this functionality with explicit control over secure connections, allowing secure request submission and integration with custom SSL implementations. Examples include sending asynchronous GET requests, streaming large request bodies, and upgrading an HTTPS connection to a WebSocket.",

      "description": "This module implements a full-featured asynchronous HTTP stack for both servers and clients, enabling non-blocking request handling, secure communication, and protocol extensions. It centers around socket addresses, request handlers, and SSL configurations, offering operations to bind listeners, submit requests, manage connections, and handle streaming or upgraded protocols like WebSockets. Users can build secure servers with custom routing, send asynchronous HTTP requests with streaming bodies, or establish WebSocket connections over HTTPS. Specific applications include serving encrypted traffic with TLS, implementing custom HTTP APIs, and handling long-lived connections with streaming I/O.",
