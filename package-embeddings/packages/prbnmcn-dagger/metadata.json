It supports Bayesian modeling through monadic workflows for Metropolis-Hastings and sequential Monte Carlo, with explicit control over resampling, scoring, and state management. Concrete use cases include parameter inference in statistical models, particle filtering for streaming data, and custom distribution definitions with conditional sampling and transformation.",
