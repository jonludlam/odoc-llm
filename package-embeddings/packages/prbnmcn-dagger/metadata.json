Operates on probabilistic programs represented as nested distributions and conditional dependencies.

It supports `'a t`, `'a dist`, and `'a kernel` types, offering transformations, folding, and state tracking across lists, arrays, and sequences. Users can chain computations, manage acceptance statistics, generate random values, and perform log-space arithmetic, with applications in MCMC simulations, probabilistic modeling, and particle filtering. Examples include transforming optional values, accumulating results in simulations, and managing stateful data flows.",
