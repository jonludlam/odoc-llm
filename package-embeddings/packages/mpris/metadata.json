It works with D-Bus-compatible types such as strings, integers, floats, and paths, integrating with media player objects exposed via the MPRIS D-Bus interface. It enables use cases like remote control of audio/video applications, dynamic UI updates in desktop environments, and metadata synchronization across media services.",

It provides access to player properties including playback status, loop mode, metadata (as key-value pairs), volume, and position (as `int64`), alongside capability flags like `can_play` and `can_seek` to determine supported features. These functions are used to implement media controllers, music streaming applications, or system-wide playback integrations that interact with MPRIS-compliant media players.",
