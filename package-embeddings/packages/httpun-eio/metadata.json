It provides operations to create connections, send requests with custom error and response handlers, and manage connection state through shutdown, closure checks, and protocol upgrades. Concrete use cases include sending HTTP requests over TLS or Unix sockets, handling streaming request bodies, and integrating with Eio-based network services.",
