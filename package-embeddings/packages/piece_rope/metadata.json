Operates on tree-based representations of text, enabling efficient handling of large or frequently modified strings. Used to implement text editors and log processing systems where performance is critical.",

      "description": "This module offers text manipulation operations like insertion, deletion, and substring extraction on `piece_rope` structures, supporting UTF-32 indices and encoding conversions, while enabling undo/redo and file serialization. It handles statistical analysis, line-based processing, and extensible text folding across UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 encodings, suitable for applications requiring efficient large-text editing or format conversion. Use cases include real-time text modification, log file analysis, and cross-encoding data transformation.",
