It exposes the internal representation used during rewriting, allowing custom transformations that require detailed parsing artifacts. Use this when implementing advanced linting rules or structural modifications that depend on precise location data or intermediate parse results.",

It supports three operations: halting traversal, continuing to process child nodes, or skipping the current node.

It supports precise edits by tracking source locations, enabling automated linting or formatting of Dune files, and includes operations to visit nodes, reset changes, or extract modified content. The child modules expose parsed values with location data, define traversal decisions to control rewriting, handle structured parse errors, and convert positions into tool-compatible location types, allowing fine-grained transformations and accurate error reporting. For example, it can selectively modify specific sections of a Dune file while preserving overall structure or report syntax errors at exact file positions.",
