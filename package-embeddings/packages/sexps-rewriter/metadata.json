It works with S-expressions, guiding how a rewriter processes nested structures or skips specific elements. Concrete use cases include selectively rewriting or linting parts of Dune files while preserving the structure of the remaining expressions.",

It transforms `Parsexp.Positions.range` values into `Loc.t` and `Loc.Range.t` representations, enabling precise error reporting and file rewriting. Useful when linting or modifying `.dune` files, where accurate location tracking is necessary for transformations and diagnostics.",

Works directly with `Parsexp.Many_and_positions.parsed_value` to enable custom transformations based on the structured representation of S-expressions.

It provides structured access to parsed S-expressions, tracks their positions, and allows selective transformations using visitor functions that can skip or modify specific nodes. Key operations include parsing with error handling, visiting and rewriting expressions with positional awareness, and generating updated file contents while preserving original structure and formatting.",
