      "description": "This module implements network device abstractions for MirageOS, providing a standardized interface for handling network I/O with support for sending and receiving Ethernet frames. It includes core operations like `write` and `read` for packet transmission and reception, working directly with memory buffers (Cstruct.t) and MAC addresses to enable low-level communication in unikernels. Submodules track transmission statistics with counters for packets and bytes, allowing monitoring and analysis of network traffic performance. Specific use cases include managing virtual network interfaces, handling raw Ethernet frames, and implementing custom network protocols with precise control over packet data and device behavior.",
