      "description": "This module offers specialized list operations such as folding, mapping, and separation, alongside arithmetic and comparison functions for arbitrary-precision integers (Z.t), including custom operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and string conversion. It handles data conversions between strings, standard integers, and Z.t, enabling seamless manipulation of large numeric values. Use cases include scenarios requiring precise arithmetic beyond native integer limits, such as financial calculations or cryptographic algorithms, as well as data processing tasks involving type transformations.",
