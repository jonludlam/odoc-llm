It works with arbitrary types `'a` and `'b`, using a provided conversion function to string for `'b` and handling large integers via `Z.t`. This function is useful for testing enumeration logic with controlled input ranges and detailed output logging.",

It provides operations for creating arrays with initial values, setting and retrieving elements by index, iterating over elements with their indices, folding over indexed elements, and copying arrays. Use cases include efficiently managing dynamically sized collections of elements where index-based access and modification are required.",

It also provides utilities for serializing integers to and from base-256 encoded strings (`bos`, `boi`, `iob`), which is useful for compact binary data representation, cryptographic protocols, or handling large integers that exceed standard numeric limits. The operations work with lists, integers, and strings, bridging functional data manipulation and low-level binary encoding needs.",
