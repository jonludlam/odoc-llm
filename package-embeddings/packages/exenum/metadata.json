It enables operations such as indexed element retrieval, cardinality constraints, interval definitions, and combinatorial unions/products for tasks like test case generation or state space exploration. Recursive enumerations and transformations via mapping or tupling allow modeling complex, lazily-evaluated sequences with customizable traversal patterns.",

It works with arbitrary types `'a` and `'b`, using a test runner configuration provided through `Exen.t` and numeric bounds expressed as `Z.t`. This supports precise testing scenarios with controlled input ranges, custom value conversion, and progress reporting at defined intervals.",

It works with polymorphic part types that represent segmented collections of values. Concrete use cases include building and transforming enumerated data structures with distinct segments, such as generating combinations or maintaining separate value groups during enumeration tasks.",

It works with enumerated types represented as `t` values, parts of enumerations, and arbitrary data stored at enumeration points. Concrete use cases include building enumerated domains from lists, mapping over enumerated values, computing products and unions of enumerations, and extracting specific parts or vectors from multi-dimensional enumeration structures.",

It operates on lists, unbounded integers, and string representations of integers, enabling tasks like cryptographic calculations, serialization of large numeric values, and custom list transformations with reversed mapping or folded accumulations. The numeric conversions facilitate efficient storage or transmission of `Z.t` values as compact binary strings.",
