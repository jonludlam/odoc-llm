It also includes functions to get the system's time measurement period, if available, in both `Ptime.span` and days-picoseconds formats. These operations are useful for precise timekeeping, timestamp generation, and handling time intervals in networked or system-level applications.",

It provides functions to set and update the current time, configure timezone adjustments, and define a repeating time interval. Concrete use cases include simulating clock behavior in virtualized environments and controlling time progression in testing or event-driven systems.",
