It works with message structures represented by the type `m` and supports field values of various types `'a` through Protocol Buffer encoding. Concrete use cases include defining message schemas for serialization and parsing in Protocol Buffer implementations.",

It works directly with the enumerated type `t` and standard OCaml types like `int`, `string`, and `formatter`. Concrete use cases include decoding and encoding field values according to their wire type during serialization and deserialization of Protocol Buffer messages.",

It includes a type `e` representing the enum values, a field type `t` for encoding and decoding enum fields, and a `constant` function to define named enum constants with their integer values. It is used to model fixed sets of named values, such as status codes or command types, in protobuf messages.",

It includes support for wire type encoding and decoding via an enumerated type `t`, enabling low-level serialization control, and handles enumerated fields with named constants for fixed value sets. You can define message schemas with typed fields, encode and decode values according to wire types, and work with enums using symbolic names and integer representations. Submodules integrate seamlessly to support full lifecycle operations on protobuf structures, from schema definition to binary encoding.",
