It supports transforming streams using `map_result`, converting lists to streams with `of_list`, and collecting stream elements into lists with `to_list` and `to_rev_list`. It is used to handle asynchronous database query results, where each element represents a row, and operations like `fold_s` allow safe error propagation when processing large datasets.",
