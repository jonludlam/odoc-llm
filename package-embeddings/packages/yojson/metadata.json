      "description": "This module offers combinator-based operations for safely traversing, extracting, and transforming JSON data structures, with a focus on type-safe access to fields, array elements, and primitive values (booleans, integers, floats, strings). It operates on the `Yojson.Safe.t` type, which handles JSON objects, arrays, and extended integer representations, enabling robust manipulation of nested structures. Typical use cases include parsing API responses by selectively extracting required fields or elements, particularly when dealing with large integers or heterogeneous JSON data.",

      "description": "This module provides functions for safely accessing and transforming JSON objects and arrays, with operations like field lookup, array indexing, type-safe value extraction (e.g., integers, strings), and traversal of nested structures. It works directly with JSON values represented as `Yojson.Basic.t`, supporting common manipulations such as filtering arrays, flattening nested data, and converting JSON fields into OCaml types. It is particularly suited for scenarios like parsing API responses where selective, robust extraction of hierarchical data is required.",

It operates on JSON values represented with preserved literal types (`Yojson.Raw.t`), enabling precise handling of integers, floats, and strings as they appear in source data. Common use cases include parsing API responses, flattening nested JSON arrays, and mapping heterogeneous JSON objects into typed OCaml values through combinators like `member`, `to_int`, and `combine`.",

      "description": "This module provides precise manipulation of JSON values with exact preservation of numeric and string literals, supporting construction, serialization, and parsing to and from strings, files, or buffers. It centers around the `t` type, which retains literal representations, and includes operations for compact or formatted output, streaming input parsing with error recovery, and exact formatting for debugging or interoperability. The child module enhances this functionality with safe navigation and transformation tools, allowing field extraction, type coercion, and structural mapping of JSON data into OCaml values using combinators like `member`, `to_int`, and `combine`. Together, they enable robust handling of JSON in applications requiring fidelity to source representations, such as API response processing or configuration parsing.",

It handles JSON objects, arrays, and numeric types, offering utilities for equality, sorting, and sequence processing, along with input/output for strings, files, and streams. The child module enhances this functionality with combinators for type-safe traversal and transformation of nested JSON structures, enabling precise extraction of fields, array elements, and primitive values. Together, they support robust handling of complex JSON data, ideal for financial calculations or numerical analysis requiring exact integer representation and detailed error diagnostics.",

It offers direct operations for constructing and inspecting JSON values, while its child modules extend this functionality with safe accessors, type conversions, and nested structure traversal. You can extract integers or strings from JSON nodes, filter arrays, or flatten deeply nested JSON into OCaml types. It is ideal for processing structured JSON data from APIs where type safety and ease of manipulation are key.",

It supports serialization, pretty-printing, structural manipulation, and precise navigation of JSON objects and arrays, using core operations like equality checks, sorting, and field extraction. Child modules enhance these capabilities with combinators for type-safe traversal, error-resilient parsing, and exact literal preservation, enabling tasks like API response processing, financial data handling, and configuration parsing.
