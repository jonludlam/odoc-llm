      "library": "yojson",
      "description": "Okay, I need to write a 2-3 sentence description for the Yojson.Basic.Util module based on the given summaries. Let me start by understanding the key points. First, the main operations: the module provides combinators for extracting fields from JSON values. The functions include field access like member and path, iteration with map, conversion to OCaml types like to_int, handling optional values with to_option, and more. They work on Yojson.Basic.t values, which are JSON nodes. The data structures involved are JSON objects and arrays. The module deals with extracting and transforming values from these structures. Use cases mentioned are reading fields from public APIs, especially when dealing with a few fields. They mention using this for simple cases, but recommend Atdgen for more complex applications. I should avoid generic phrases and not mention the module name. Let me structure the sentences. First, identify the main operations: extracting fields, transforming values, handling optional data. Then the data structures: JSON objects and arrays. Use cases: parsing API responses, especially for simple or partial data extraction. Wait, the user said not to repeat the module name, so I shouldn't mention Yojson.Basic.Util in the description. Also, avoid phrases like \"provides functions\" if possible. Maybe start with \"This module supports...\" but no, the example description starts with \"This module provides...\" Hmm, but the user says not to repeat the module name. The example description in the problem statement says \"Module Description: This module provides...\" but perhaps that's part of the example. Wait, looking at the user's instruction: \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So I shouldn't start with \"This module provides...\". Instead, use more specific verbs. So rephrase: The module offers combinators for extracting fields and converting JSON values to OCaml types. It works with JSON objects and arrays, supporting safe traversal and handling of optional or nested data. Commonly used for parsing API responses where only specific fields are needed. Wait, but the sample description in the problem's example starts with \"This module provides...\" but the user says not to repeat the module name. So maybe avoid that. Let me check the example again. The user provided a sample module description which starts with \"This module provides...\" but according to the instructions, the assistant should not repeat the module name. So perhaps the sample is not following the instruction. Wait, the user says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So the answer shouldn't mention the module name. The sample description in the problem statement does mention the module name, but that's part of the example. Wait, no, the user's instruction says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So the correct approach is to not mention the module name in the description. So, the first sentence should start by identifying the main operations. The functions are for extracting fields, transforming, converting to OCaml types. The data structures are JSON objects and arrays, working on Yojson.Basic.t values. Use cases: parsing API data, handling optional fields, extracting specific values. Putting it all together: The module offers combinators for extracting fields and converting JSON values to OCaml types, with support for handling optional data and nested structures. It operates on JSON objects and arrays through safe traversal and transformation, suitable for parsing API responses where only specific fields are required. Functions include path-based access, list iteration, and type-safe extraction, allowing robust handling of heterogeneous JSON data. Wait, but need to check if that's 2-3 sentences. Let me count. First sentence: main operations and data structures. Second: use cases and functions. Maybe split into three sentences if needed. Alternatively, condense. Alternative version: This module provides functions for safely extracting and transforming values from JSON objects and arrays, including field access, type conversion, and optional value handling. It operates on JSON nodes represented as Yojson.Basic.t values, supporting idiomatic traversal and iteration over nested structures. Commonly used for parsing API responses where selective extraction of fields or elements is needed, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous or partially defined data. Wait, but the user said not to repeat the module name, which I haven't. The first sentence starts with \"This module provides...\" which might be okay, but the user said not to use generic phrases. Hmm. Maybe \"The module offers...\" instead. Also, the mention of Yojson.Basic.t is necessary because the data type is part of the module's functionality. The use cases are mentioned as parsing API responses with selective extraction. I think this meets the requirements. Let me check again: - Main operations: extracting fields, transforming values, converting types, handling optional data. - Data structures: JSON objects and arrays, working on Yojson.Basic.t nodes. - Use cases: parsing API responses, selective extraction. Yes. Also mentions traversal and iteration over nested structures. The functions are for safe and idiomatic use. The answer should be two or three sentences. The example I wrote is",
