It operates on types representing HTTP statuses, Gemtext content, and raw payloads, while supporting TLS configuration for secure communication. Typical use cases include building servers with rate-limited endpoints, request logging, and dynamic content generation in MirageOS environments.",

      "description": "This module provides networking and server runtime functionalities for MirageOS applications, focusing on HTTP routing, middleware composition, and TLS-secured server configuration. It operates on Mirage network stacks (`Stack.t`), routing constructs (`router`, `scope`), and handler functions transforming requests into responses with support for text, gemtext, and raw formats. Use cases include building secure web servers with logging, rate limiting, virtual hosting, and middleware pipelines to handle request/response cycles in Mirage-based deployments.",

      "description": "This module defines a module type `S` that specifies the required interface for implementing Mirage OS-compatible components, abstracting over network devices, clocks, and I/O for unikernel environments. It supports building structured applications targeting backends like Unix or Xen, ensuring consistent handling of time, networking, and concurrency. The child modules enable HTTP routing, middleware composition, and TLS-secured server configuration, working with types like `Stack.t`, `router`, and `scope` to handle requests and generate responses in formats such as text and Gemtext. Use cases include constructing MirageOS web servers with features like virtual hosting, rate limiting, logging, and dynamic content generation.",
