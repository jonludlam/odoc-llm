It operates on Mirage network stacks, HTTP request/response objects, and TLS configurations, utilizing `IO.t` for asynchronous operations. Typical applications include deploying secure web services, API endpoints, and virtual hosts with rate limiting and structured logging in MirageOS environments.",

It works with abstract data types representing network stacks, clocks, and I/O devices, tailored for Mirage unikernels. Concrete use cases include structuring implementations of TCP/IP stacks or storage backends that can be compiled both natively and as Xen guests.",
