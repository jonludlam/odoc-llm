It operates on Bitcoin-specific data structures like block hashes, transaction outputs, addresses, and private keys, supporting use cases such as transaction creation, chain state queries, wallet encryption management, and peer-to-peer network configuration. Key applications include building and signing transactions, verifying blockchain integrity, and controlling node behavior for mining or network participation.",

It includes abstract types to manage network connections and JSON data, enabling seamless interaction with the Bitcoin API. Use cases include constructing and validating transactions, handling key pairs for wallets, and converting monetary amounts between internal and external numeric formats during API requests or responses.",
