Concrete use cases include generating line-based diffs for text files or comparing sequences of tokens in version-controlled data.",

      "description": "This module implements a basic diffing algorithm that compares two sequences and identifies insertions, deletions, and common elements, using a user-provided comparison interface to determine element equality. It operates on arrays of a generic type, producing a structured list of diff operations that represent changes between the input sequences. The comparison interface allows customization of equality and ordering, enabling diffing of diverse data such as text lines or binary tokens. Example uses include generating line-based diffs for text files or synchronizing versioned data streams.",
