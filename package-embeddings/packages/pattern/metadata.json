Works with Parsetree.expression and user-defined types through lifters or quotations. Used to debug complex pattern matches by explicitly showing where a value deviates from expected structure.",

It processes structured data with location and path information to enable tasks like code generation, refactoring, and analysis. Specific use cases include generating boilerplate code, rewriting expressions, and analyzing variable bindings during metaprogramming workflows.",
