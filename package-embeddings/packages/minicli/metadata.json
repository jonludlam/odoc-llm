      "description": "<think> Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a 2-3 sentence description of the CLI module based on the provided summaries. First, I need to identify the main operations. The first chunk says it parses command-line arguments, extracting various types like int, char, string, etc. It also mentions enforcing complete option consumption and handling defaults. The second chunk mentions a type 'option_strings' as a list of strings but no operations. But since there are no functions described there, maybe I can ignore that part. The user said not to use generic phrases, so I need to be specific. So the main types of operations are parsing command-line args, handling different data types, ensuring all options are used, and default values. The data structures would be the list of strings representing the command line, and maybe the option_strings type. Use cases would be applications needing to process command-line inputs with various argument types, like configuration settings or user inputs. Wait, the user said not to repeat the module name. The example response starts with \"The module provides...\" but the user says not to use the module name. Wait, the original instruction says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So I shouldn't say \"the module\" but maybe refer to it as \"the CLI functionality\" or something else. Wait, the example given in the problem statement for the module description is \"The CLI module provides...\" but the user says not to repeat the module name. Hmm, maybe the user wants to avoid using the module name in the description. Wait, the original instruction says \"Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So I shouldn't say \"the module\" but perhaps refer to it as \"the CLI functionality\" or \"this module\" but maybe the user wants to avoid even that. Wait, the example given in the problem's own module description is \"Module: CLI\" and then the description. But the user's instruction says to not repeat the module name. So perhaps the answer should not mention \"CLI module\" but just describe the functionality. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"write a 2-3 sentence description that: - Identifies the main types of operations this module provides - Specifies what data structures or types it works with - Mentions specific use cases where applicable. Do NOT use generic phrases or repeat the module name.\" So the description should not mention the module name. So instead of saying \"The CLI module provides...\", it should start with something else. For example, \"Functions are provided to parse command-line arguments...\" or similar. So putting it all together: The functionality includes parsing command-line arguments, extracting various data types (int, char, string, float, bool) from a string list. It enforces complete option consumption and handles default values for optional arguments. It works with lists of strings representing the command line and a type for option strings. Use cases include applications needing to process user inputs or configuration settings via command-line parameters. But need to make sure it's 2-3 sentences. Let me check the example response. The example given by the user in the problem statement (the one they provided as an example) is: \"The module provides functions to parse command-line arguments, extracting mandatory or optional values of various types (int, char, string, float, bool) from a string list representing the command line. It includes mechanisms to enforce complete option consumption and handle default values for optional arguments.\" But the user says not to repeat the module name. So perhaps the example is not following that, but the user's instruction says to not repeat the module name. So maybe the answer should not mention \"the module\" but refer to it as \"this functionality\" or \"these functions\". So maybe: Functions are provided to parse command-line arguments, extracting mandatory or optional values of various types (int, char, string, float, bool) from a string list representing the command line. They enforce complete option consumption and handle default values for optional arguments, working with lists of strings and a type for option strings. This is useful for applications requiring structured processing of user inputs or configuration settings via command-line parameters. But need to check if that's 2-3 sentences. The first sentence covers operations and data structures. The second sentence covers use cases. But maybe combine into two sentences. Also, the second chunk mentions 'option_strings' as a list of strings but no operations. So the data structures include the string list and the option_strings type. But since there are no functions for option_strings, maybe just mention the string list. Or perhaps mention that it works with lists of strings and the option_strings type, even if no operations are provided. But the user says \"specifies what data structures or types it works with\". Since the second chunk defines option_strings but no functions, maybe it's part of the data structures. But the first chunk mentions \"a string list representing the command line\". So the data structures are the string list and the option_strings type. So the description should mention that.",
