It supports core operations like hostname-to-IP resolution, raw DNS reply handling, and configurable resolver behavior using custom transports and DNS server lists. Key data types include domain names, IP addresses, DNS resource records, and configurable contexts for managing timeouts, EDNS, and DNSSEC validation. Examples include resolving \"example.com\" to an IPv4 or IPv6 address, constructing and sending custom DNS queries, and parsing and validating DNS responses with DNSSEC support.",

It supports operations such as resolving domain names to IP addresses, querying resource records, and handling raw DNS responses, with cryptographic RNG for secure communication. The transport submodule manages socket connections, message exchange with timeouts, and resource cleanup, allowing concrete interactions with DNS servers via standard Unix networking. Example usage includes initiating a DNS lookup with `resolve` or sending a custom DNS query using `query`, with underlying transport handled automatically or configurable per connection.",
