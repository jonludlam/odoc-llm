It supports operations like `gethostbyname` for IPv4 lookups, `gethostbyname6` for IPv6, and `get_resource_record` for arbitrary DNS record queries, returning structured results or detailed error information. It works with domain names, IP addresses, and DNS resource records, using a provided transport stack for network communication.",
