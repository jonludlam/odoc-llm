It operates on domain names, DNS record types, and query state objects derived from initial query setup. Used to construct and validate DNS transactions in applications requiring precise control over query generation and response handling.",

It works with types such as `context`, `io_addr`, and `t`, and incorporates random number generation and a monotonic clock for reliable timing. It enables DNS resolution with custom timeouts and nameservers, allowing queries to be sent and responses received efficiently. Example tasks include resolving domain names, configuring alternative DNS servers, and managing connection lifecycles.",
