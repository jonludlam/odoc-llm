Provides functions to iterate over ranges, filter active hosts, and apply custom processing to each element. Used to efficiently scan and analyze network ports across multiple hosts.",

      "description": "The module provides operations for lazily processing finite sequences, including mapping, filtering, and transforming, as well as generating and combining sequences through methods like interleaving and Cartesian products. It works with lazy sequences and enumerators, enabling efficient handling of large datasets and combinatorial tasks such as subset generation and bitset enumeration. Specific use cases include on-demand evaluation of large data and generating constrained combinations.",

It supports signed and unsigned 64-bit integer handling, enabling tasks like low-level bit manipulation, numeric type coercion, and precise decimal-to-string serialization. Use cases include system-level programming, cryptographic computations, and scenarios requiring exact 64-bit integer arithmetic without overflow.",
