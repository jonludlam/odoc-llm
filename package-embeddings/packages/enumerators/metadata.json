It works with finite sequences derived from lists, sets, ranges, or bitsets, supporting transformations and queries while preserving laziness for memory efficiency. Typical applications include processing large datasets without full materialization, generating structured combinations, and implementing algorithms requiring controlled enumeration of nested or variable-length data.",
