It operates on a type `t` representing durations, though no internal data manipulation is specified. Use cases include logging, user-facing time displays, and API data serialization where structured time representations are required.",

It supports both immutable transformations and in-place modifications, along with timezone conversions, locale-based formatting, and precise granularity-controlled comparisons. Use cases include scheduling, logging with timestamp adjustments, and internationalization tasks requiring localized date representations.",

It operates on a type `t` that encapsulates duration data, though no direct manipulation of this type is defined. Use cases include displaying human-readable time intervals or standardizing duration data for logging, user interfaces, or data exchange.",
