It enables advanced graph manipulation through path, tree, partition, and group structures, facilitating tasks like traversal, spanning tree construction, and pathfinding. The module includes core data types such as `Node.t`, `Edge.t`, `Node.Set.t`, `Edge.Map.t`, and `Graph.t`, along with operations for set algebra, hashing, serialization, and binary I/O. Submodules enhance functionality with S-expression and binary parsing, hash folding, equivalence-based indexing, and hybrid data structures like hash queues, enabling efficient node and edge management, labeled graph construction, and persistent graph storage.",
