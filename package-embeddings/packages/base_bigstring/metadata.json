It includes operations for reading and writing 64-bit integers at specific offsets, allowing precise access to raw memory for tasks like parsing binary file formats or implementing network protocols. The direct API handles common integer sizes and byte orders, while the child module extends this with specialized 64-bit access. For example, you can extract a 64-bit unsigned integer from a specific position in a bigstring using little-endian byte order, or write a signed 32-bit integer into a buffer with big-endian encoding.",
