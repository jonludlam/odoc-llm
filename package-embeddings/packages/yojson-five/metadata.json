It supports converting JSON values to strings, outputting them to channels or formatters, and comparing JSON values for equality. Concrete use cases include reading configuration files, processing JSON API responses, and validating JSON input in command-line tools.",

It operates primarily on the `Yojson_five.Basic.t` type, representing JSON values such as objects, arrays, and primitives, and provides operations for conversion, comparison, and formatted output. You can read JSON from a file while tracking line numbers, convert a JSON value into a compact or formatted string, or validate JSON input by comparing it against expected structures.",
