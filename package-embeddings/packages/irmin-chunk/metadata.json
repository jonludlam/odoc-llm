It works with integer and enumeration types to control how content is split into blocks. Concrete use cases include tuning block sizes for efficient storage in 4K sectors or optimizing deduplication granularity.",

It provides operations to check existence (`mem`), retrieve values (`find`), and store new values (`add`) by their hash, with `unsafe_add` allowing direct key assignment. Designed for use with Irmin backends, it supports efficient storage of chunked data using consistent hashing.",

It provides operations to define and manipulate chunking strategies, including setting chunk sizes, minimum thresholds, and modes like `Best_fit` or `Max`. These configurations optimize storage efficiency for binary files and block-level access in Irmin backends, enabling precise control over deduplication and sector alignment. Submodules extend this functionality by organizing strategy-specific keys and enumeration types for dynamic tuning.",

      "description": "This module organizes data into a tree of fixed-size chunks addressed by hash, using an append-only store to efficiently manage large files and binary content within Irmin's content-addressable model. It provides core operations to split content into blocks, track them via hash-based keys, and reconstruct data from stored chunks, supporting use cases like versioned file storage and block device backends. The content-addressable store allows checking existence, retrieving, and storing values by hash, while the configuration module tunes chunking strategies with parameters like block size and allocation modes. Together, these components enable precise control over storage efficiency, deduplication, and access patterns for structured and unstructured data.",
