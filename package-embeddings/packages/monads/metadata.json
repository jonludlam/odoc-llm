      "description": "This module orchestrates complex state interactions by combining monadic sequencing with hierarchical state management. It centers around a computation type that supports `bind`, `map`, and `both` for composing stateful logic, alongside `fork` and `switch` to isolate or redirect state changes. For example, `fork` can create a scoped state branch that merges back into a parent context, while `switch` allows dynamic reassignment of active state branches. Together with its submodules, it structures multi-context workflows where computations can evolve independently or in concert.",
