It operates on a mutex data structure that enforces mutual exclusion. This is used to safely update shared state in multi-threaded applications, such as incrementing a counter or modifying a shared cache.",

Works with integer-based resource counts and a opaque semaphore type. Used to control access to shared resources in concurrent programs, such as limiting the number of simultaneous database connections or thread pool usage.",
