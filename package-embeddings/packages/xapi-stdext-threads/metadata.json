      "description": "This module implements a synchronization primitive for thread delays with optional early signaling. It provides a type `t` representing a delay object, along with functions to block a thread for a specified time (`wait`) and to wake it early (`signal`). It is used to coordinate timing between threads, such as in wait-and-notify patterns where a thread waits for a condition or timeout.",

It works with `Stdlib.Mutex.t` and arbitrary functions of type `unit -> 'a`. A concrete use case is ensuring thread-safe execution of critical sections, such as updating shared state in a multi-threaded server.",

      "description": "This module extends thread management by enabling parallel iteration over lists with synchronized execution, exception handling, and delayed operations. It supports running tasks concurrently, such as processing network requests or batch file operations, using mutexes and delay primitives for coordination. The synchronization submodule offers a delay type for timed waits and early wakeups, while the execution submodule ensures thread-safe critical sections via mutex-wrapped function calls. Together, these components allow structured concurrency with controlled timing and safe access to shared resources.",

It works with a semaphore type `t` and integer values to control access to shared resources. Concrete use cases include limiting concurrent thread execution, managing resource pools, and ensuring atomic access to finite system resources like network connections or file handles.",

It includes parallel iteration with synchronized execution, exception handling, and delayable operations, along with counting semaphores for limiting access to resources. The main data types are threads, delays, and semaphores (`t`), supporting operations like parallel map, mutex-protected critical sections, and weighted resource acquisition. You can use it to run batch network requests concurrently, throttle thread counts, or manage access to limited resources like file handles or connection pools.",
