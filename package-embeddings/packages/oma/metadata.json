It operates on the `point` and `region` types defined in the parent module, working with their unstable runtime representations. These operations are useful for low-level debugging or performance-critical scenarios where direct inspection of the data structure's state is required.",

It provides operations to create regions, insert points before or after existing points, compare the order of two points, and invalidate points or intervals of points. Concrete use cases include managing dynamic sequences where elements must maintain a strict order, such as in certain types of version control systems, document editing models, or ordered task scheduling.",
