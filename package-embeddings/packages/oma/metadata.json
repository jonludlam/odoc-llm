It provides direct access to a point's numeric tag, neighboring points, and the first or last point in a region, along with functions to traverse all active points in order. These operations are useful for debugging or for implementing custom logic that requires visibility into the underlying structure's current layout.",

      "description": "This library implements an order maintenance data structure that supports efficient insertion of points relative to existing ones and comparison of their order within a region. It provides core operations to create regions, insert points before or after others, and compare the order of any two points, enabling dynamic sequence management with logarithmic time complexity. The child module exposes internal state such as point tags, predecessor and successor links, and region bounds, allowing traversal of active points and inspection of structural layout. Together, they support use cases like maintaining ordered collections with frequent insertions, deletions, and range invalidations, while offering visibility into the underlying representation for advanced customization.",
