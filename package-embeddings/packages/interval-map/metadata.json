It supports operations like `next`, which retrieves the next interval-value pair and updates the generator state, and `fold`, which allows accumulating results by processing each interval and its values sequentially. It is used to iterate over interval maps in a controlled, stateful manner without exposing internal structure.",

It supports traversal through stateful generators, interval comparison with precise bound handling, and operations like `query_interval` to retrieve overlapping entries or `mem` to check for interval presence. Intervals are built from bounds that can be included, excluded, or unbounded, allowing exact range reasoning in applications like scheduling or financial analysis. The generator interface enables controlled iteration over interval-value pairs, while bound and interval modules provide the foundational logic for range comparison and overlap computation.",
