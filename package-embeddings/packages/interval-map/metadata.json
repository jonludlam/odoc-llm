It works with `Interval.t` and lists of values, enabling iteration through a sequence of intervals. Use it to efficiently traverse or accumulate results from interval data, such as merging overlapping intervals or computing aggregate values per interval.",

Use cases include implementing interval maps with inclusive/exclusive ranges and managing overlapping or adjacent intervals in scheduling or numerical range analysis.",
