It handles the WebSocket handshake, upgrades the connection, and dispatches incoming messages to user-defined handlers. It works with network flows, WebSocket configurations, and input handlers to manage bidirectional communication over WebSockets. Use this to build clients that interact with WebSocket-based APIs, such as real-time messaging services or live data feeds.",
