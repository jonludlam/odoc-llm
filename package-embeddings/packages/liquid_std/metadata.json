Operates on strings and lists of string tuples representing encoding/decoding rules. Used to sanitize URL components, escape special characters in queries, and transform text according to specific encoding schemes.",

      "description": "This module offers type conversions, error handling, and locale-aware formatting for numerical values, strings, and currency, alongside list and object operations. It works with standard types like floats and integers, as well as custom types such as `weight_units` and `Liquid_syntax.Syntax.value`, employing result-wrapping patterns for robust data processing. Use cases include internationalization workflows, data validation, and structured data transformations in applications requiring precise type management.",

Operates on lists of `Liquid_syntax.Syntax.value` wrapped in `Base.List.t` and returns results or error strings. Used to manipulate collections in templating logic, such as extracting first elements, joining items with separators, or filtering based on conditions.",
