It supports operations to generate callback names, construct URLs, and manage timeouts for external API calls. Use it to interact with web services that require JSONP for cross-domain communication, such as legacy APIs or certain browser-based data sources.",

It includes `sleep` to suspend a thread for a specified duration and `yield` to temporarily relinquish control, enabling cooperative multitasking. These operations are essential for implementing non-blocking delays and event loop integration in client-side OCaml applications.",

It provides typed functions like `perform` and `get` to send requests and return results in Lwt threads, enabling non-blocking I/O in client-side web applications. Use cases include fetching remote data, uploading files, and interacting with REST APIs directly from OCaml code.",

It works with DOM event targets and provides configurable listeners with options for capture phase, passive behavior, and concurrency control through loop strategies (e.g., buffered or limited loops). Use cases include coordinating UI interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, form submissions), managing media state changes (e.g., play/pause), and efficiently handling high-frequency events like window resizing with rate-limited execution.",

It supports working directly with JavaScript file and blob objects, enabling operations like reading files as text, binary strings, or data URLs, with encoding support. Concrete use cases include uploading files, processing user-selected content, and manipulating binary data in web applications.",

      "description": "This module enables client-side OCaml applications to perform asynchronous I/O and event handling in the browser by integrating with JavaScript's runtime. It provides core data types like Lwt threads and JavaScript-compatible values, along with operations for HTTP requests, JSONP, file and blob manipulation, DOM event listening, and cooperative multitasking via sleep and yield. You can use it to fetch data from REST APIs, handle user interactions like clicks and keypresses, read files selected by users, manage media playback events, and coordinate cross-domain API calls using JSONP. Specific examples include uploading a file by reading it as a data URL, waiting for a click event with a timeout, or polling an external service with custom headers and asynchronous callbacks.",
