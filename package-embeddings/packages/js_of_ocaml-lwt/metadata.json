It works with string URLs, form data, blobs, and typed arrays, returning parsed HTTP responses as threads. Concrete use cases include fetching JSON APIs, uploading files with progress bars, or streaming binary data in web applications.",

It works with URLs and callback name generation, allowing users to either provide a fixed URL or a function to construct URLs dynamically.

It includes `sleep` to suspend a thread for a specified duration and `yield` to temporarily pause and resume a thread. These operations are useful for implementing delays, cooperative multitasking, or rate-limiting in web applications.",

      "description": "This module enables asynchronous event handling for DOM interactions using Lwt threads, supporting mouse, keyboard, media, pointer, and clipboard events with control over capture/bubbling phases. It operates on DOM event targets like input elements, windows, and media components, allowing non-blocking waits for events such as clicks, key presses, play/pause, or resize changes. Specific use cases include waiting for user input before continuing execution, reacting to media state changes, and throttling window resize handlers while maintaining concurrency safety.",

It supports working with JavaScript-compatible data types such as `blob`, `arrayBuffer`, `arrayBufferView`, and strings, and includes utilities for handling file metadata and events. Concrete use cases include reading user-uploaded files as text or binary data, converting data to blobs for transmission, and monitoring file read progress via event listeners.",

It operates on URLs, form data, blobs, typed arrays, and DOM event targets, returning results as Lwt threads. Concrete use cases include fetching JSON APIs, uploading files with progress tracking, reading user-uploaded content asynchronously, handling user input events non-blockingly, and implementing delays or cooperative multitasking in web applications.",
