It includes functions for transforming, filtering, and converting maps to sequences or lists, with utilities for handling optional values and key-based searches. This structure is particularly useful for managing hierarchical data such as RSS feed metadata or attribute collections, where string identifiers are used to access or organize elements.",

It operates on `xmltree` structures and `Rss_types.channel_t` values, handling complex conversions for optional fields, namespaces, and date formats. Typical use cases include ingesting RSS feeds from files or streams, modifying feed data programmatically, and generating valid RSS XML output with customizable formatting for channels and items.",
