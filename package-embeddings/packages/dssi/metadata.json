It supports operations for managing programs, MIDI controllers, and running synthesizer instances with or without additive processing. These functions are used to control DSSI plugins in audio processing contexts, such as loading presets, handling events, and managing multiple synth voices.",

      "description": "This module provides a binding to the DSSI SDK for real-time audio plugin development, handling MIDI and audio processing events through structured types like system, result, note on, and note off. It initializes the library and manages event loops, while its child modules support dynamic plugin loading and configuration via shared libraries and descriptor manipulation. You can load DSSI plugins from disk, retrieve their LADSPA descriptors, manage programs and MIDI controllers, and run synthesizer instances with precise audio processing control. Examples include instantiating a plugin from a shared library, configuring its parameters, and processing audio with running synth voices in a real-time context.",
