Supports extraction of values from monadic contexts, management of HTTP streams, and custom error propagation. Operations include lifting computations, parsing responses, and managing I/O within a threaded environment. Example tasks include fetching remote data, processing streaming responses, and handling HTTP errors in a controlled manner.",
