      "description": "This module offers low-level operations for constructing and manipulating maps and sets implemented as Patricia Trees, which are prefix tries optimized for efficient merging through physical equality preservation. It operates on polymorphic key and value types, enabling heterogeneous data storage and hash-consed representations, while supporting existential quantification for cross-map interactions. Key applications include priority queues leveraging unsigned key ordering and merge-heavy workflows where shared subtrees minimize memory usage and accelerate set/map combinations.",

      "description": "This module implements maps where values have a uniform type regardless of their keys, supporting operations like insertion, lookup, and traversal with values that do not vary per key type. It works with integer-identified keys mapped to a fixed value type, structured internally using Patricia Trees for efficient merging and memory sharing. Concrete use cases include maintaining sets of typed identifiers with associated metadata, or managing configurations where keys represent distinct entities but values follow a consistent structure.",

It defines core data types such as maps with customizable node representations and sets with weak or hash-consed semantics, along with operations like `add`, `find`, `remove`, `union`, `intersection`, and `pop_unsigned_minimum`. Examples include building versioned data structures with shared subtrees, managing sparse priority queues with unique integer keys, and synchronizing state between heterogeneous maps using cross-type operations like `filter_map_no_share` and `update_multiple_from_foreign`. Child modules extend functionality with polymorphic key-value handling, hash-consing for structural equality, and weak references for automatic garbage collection of unused elements.",
