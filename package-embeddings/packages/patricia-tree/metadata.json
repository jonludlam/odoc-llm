It works directly with key-value pairs and branch nodes, using `int` as the internal representation for prefixes and branching bits. It is used internally by `MakeMap` and `MakeHeterogeneousMap` to represent the underlying tree structure while maintaining efficient access and conversion through the `view` function.",
