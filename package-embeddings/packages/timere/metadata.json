It supports building datetime values with fields like year, month, day, hour, and nanoseconds, resolving ambiguities using a lean direction. Concrete use cases include parsing and normalizing partial datetime inputs, such as scheduling rules or recurring events with specific time constraints.",

It operates on ranges of integers representing months, ISO weeks, month days, and weekdays, producing contiguous or merged values where overlapping ranges are resolved. These functions are useful for expanding scheduling constraints into discrete time units for further processing or display.",

It works with time intervals (`t`) and datetime components (years, months, days) to model constraints for scheduling, filtering sequences of timestamps, or resolving recurring time boundaries. Specific use cases include defining periodic schedules, transforming timestamp sequences with temporal logic, and resolving complex date-time constraints into concrete intervals.",
