It operates on ranges of integers and weekdays, resolving overlapping or nested ranges into ordered, non-redundant sequences or lists. These functions are useful for processing calendar-based schedules, such as expanding month ranges into individual months or weekday ranges into individual weekdays.",

It resolves irregularities by leaning toward earlier or later valid interpretations. Useful for creating precise datetime values from partial or uncertain inputs, such as parsing user-defined schedules or handling daylight saving transitions.",

      "description": "This module combines temporal constraint modeling with utilities for datetime construction and range expansion. It enables users to define and manipulate complex time intervals using operations like union, intersection, and shifting, while child modules handle the expansion of ranged calendar values and the precise creation of datetime points, even under ambiguity. Users can model recurring events, resolve overlapping schedules, and generate concrete time points from high-level constraints. For example, you can express a weekly meeting with exceptions, flatten date ranges for scheduling reports, or construct valid datetimes during daylight saving changes.",
