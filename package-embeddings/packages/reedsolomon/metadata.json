      "description": "This module implements polynomial arithmetic over finite fields and ring-like domains, supporting operations such as addition, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and evaluation. It represents polynomials as arrays of coefficients, with arithmetic defined by underlying field or ring operations, enabling tasks like Reed-Solomon encoding, decoding, and symbolic manipulation. Submodules extend functionality to general polynomial transformations, including degree management, GCD computation, and scalar operations, facilitating applications in error correction, interpolation, and algebraic computation. Examples include generating error-correcting codes, evaluating polynomials at specific points, and simplifying algebraic expressions through division and reduction.",

It includes low-level operations like addition, multiplication, XOR, and modulus on wrapped integer types and finite field elements, supporting precise numerical manipulation and type conversions between `int32`, `int64`, `float`, and strings. Submodules enable polynomial arithmetic, bitmask operations, and finite field calculations, facilitating tasks such as encoding and decoding data in storage and transmission systems. Examples include performing Galois Field multiplication for error correction, converting between numeric types during data serialization, and applying bitwise shifts in low-level protocol implementations.",

It supports core data types including polynomials, byte arrays, and matrices over GF(2\u207f), with operations like addition, multiplication, inversion, and polynomial division, alongside algorithms such as Berlekamp-Massey, Chien search, and Forney\u2019s method. Users can construct generator polynomials for encoding, recover corrupted data in distributed storage or satellite communications, and perform matrix manipulations for structured error correction. Examples include encoding a message with a (255,235) code, decoding corrupted transmissions in ATSC, and solving linear systems during data recovery using Gauss-Jordan elimination over GF(2\u2078).",
