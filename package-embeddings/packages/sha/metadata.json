It enables conversion between binary and hexadecimal hash representations, equality checks for digests, and secure checksum generation for files or streams. These features are particularly suited for data integrity verification, cryptographic applications, and efficient handling of large or streamed datasets.",

It supports use cases like data integrity verification, secure communication, and persistent hash storage through operations that handle both incremental updates and direct digest generation, while providing safe/unsafe variants for performance-critical scenarios. The module also facilitates digest comparison and format conversions between internal, binary, and hexadecimal representations.",
