It operates on structured data like configuration contexts, metadata, and command-line/environment values, enabling scenarios where configurations are set via files or environment variables without a command-line interface. Use cases include handling plugin-specific options with prefixed names and maintaining isolated configuration states.",

It enables safe equality checks via MD5-based digests, particularly useful for handling non-structural data such as filenames or directories where direct comparison is impractical. Use cases include configuring command-line tools and ensuring consistent representation of parameters through combinators that refine, rename, or customize default values.",
