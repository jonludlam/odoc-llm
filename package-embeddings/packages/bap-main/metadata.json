It operates on `Bap_main.ctxt` and `info` types to enable introspection of runtime contexts, facilitating tasks such as command-line configuration, dynamic parameter resolution, and debugging via structured context inspection. The `pp` function further aids in visualizing configuration states for analysis or troubleshooting.",

It supports primitive types like integers and strings, as well as structured types such as lists, tuples, and file paths, with customizable separators and equality checks via MD5 digests. It is particularly useful for handling command-line arguments, configuration files, and resource paths where precise data validation and canonical representation are required.",

It works with `Bap_main.ctxt` and configuration parameters of type `'a Bap_main.Extension.Configuration.param`. Use this module to conveniently retrieve typed configuration values using infix notation, such as `ctxt-->param`, in extension code.",

It provides functions to format and register custom error printers, enabling detailed error reporting during extension execution. Concrete use cases include handling plugin initialization failures, invalid command-line arguments, and unexpected internal states during binary analysis workflows.",
