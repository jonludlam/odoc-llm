      "description": "This module defines a polymorphic variant type `t` representing an extensible set of possible errors that can occur during BAP extension execution, including configuration issues, invalid inputs, exit requests, unknown plugins, and unexpected bugs. It provides functions `pp` for pretty-printing errors and `register_printer` to extend error formatting capabilities. Concrete use cases include handling plugin loading failures, reporting misconfigurations, and debugging unexpected extension behavior.",

It provides operations to declare commands with various argument types, including positional arguments, switches, flags, and dictionaries, along with combinators to build complex command grammars. It is used to extend BAP's command-line interface with custom commands and structured input parsing.",

It operates on the `Bap_main.ctxt` structure to store and resolve configurations, allowing introspection of plugins, commands, and build-time settings like paths or versions. Typical use cases include defining CLI/environment-configurable options for plugins, validating parameter dependencies, and generating human-readable configuration snapshots via the `pp` function.",

It works with string-based format specifiers and `Format.formatter` values to produce structured log output. Concrete use cases include emitting diagnostic messages during plugin execution and reporting progress on long-running tasks with optional task labels and completion stages.",

It handles non-structural data (e.g., file paths) and enumerations, using MD5 digests to approximate equality when direct comparison is infeasible. These features are used to process command-line arguments, configure BAP extensions, and define custom parameter types with domain-specific validation and textual representations.",

      "description": "This module orchestrates the development of BAP extensions by integrating core declaration mechanics with structured command-line interfaces, configuration handling, and error management. It centers around `declare` for registering extension logic and `documentation` for describing plugins, working with contexts and results to support custom commands, plugin configuration, and error propagation. The module\u2019s child components refine this functionality: one defines extensible errors and their formatting, another builds command grammars with typed arguments, a third manages typed configuration parameters, a fourth offers infix syntax for context-based parameter access, and a fifth supports custom parameter data types with parsing and validation. Together, they enable tasks like adding CLI commands with structured inputs, defining plugin configuration options with validation, and handling extension errors with precise diagnostics.",

It supports emitting diagnostic output, tracking execution flow, and reporting progress from plugins through operations like debug, info, warning, and error. The child module extends this by creating formatted log reporters that integrate with `Format.formatter`, enabling rich, structured output during plugin execution. Together, they allow precise control over logging verbosity, message formatting, and progress tracking in both short and long-running operations.",

It operates on contexts that encapsulate environment state and supports dynamic plugin loading and custom analysis passes. The child modules refine extension development by enabling structured CLI commands, typed configuration, error handling, and custom parameter parsing.
