It provides functional transformations like mapping, folding, filtering, and merging, along with sequence interconversion for incremental construction or ordered processing. Typical use cases include managing hierarchical configurations, aggregating log entries with string identifiers, and processing ordered key-value data where efficient lookups and structural composition are required.",

It supports operations to construct and access named parts of the tree, retrieve node values by path, and maintain mutable state through the `_t` type. Concrete use cases include organizing log data in a nested hierarchy, dynamically building and querying structured configurations, and managing scoped identifiers with hierarchical relationships.",
