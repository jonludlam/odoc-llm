Supports operations for converting between integers and byte arrays, ensuring consistent representation across systems. Examples include serializing a 63-bit integer to a 8-byte array and reconstructing the value from its encoded form.

Constructs bidirectional character-to-integer mappings from a given string, allowing efficient encoding and decoding operations. For example, it can convert a byte array to a base58 string by applying a transformation and using a custom character set. It also supports reversing the process, translating encoded integers back into their original byte representation.",
