It manipulates a tuple type consisting of a string and an integer array, representing the alphabet and its inverse mapping. Concrete use cases include encoding and decoding data using non-standard Base58 character sets, such as generating Bitcoin addresses or handling custom binary-to-text encodings.",

      "description": "This module supports arithmetic and bitwise operations on 63-bit signed integers, including overflow-safe addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and bitwise logic (AND/OR/XOR/NOT), alongside precise shifts and comparisons. It facilitates numeric conversions between 63-bit integers and 32/64-bit signed/unsigned integers, floats, and string representations, with defined behavior for edge cases like division by zero. These capabilities are useful for low-level systems programming, binary data serialization, and applications requiring exact control over integer representation and bit-level manipulation.",
