It works with trace data through `Trace_core.collector` and `Trace_subscriber.t` types, directing output to a file specified at setup. Concrete use cases include logging trace events to disk for analysis by the tldrs daemon, particularly in production environments where persistent trace storage is required.",

It operates on trace state (`st`), timestamps, thread IDs, spans, and structured data. Concrete use cases include capturing span lifecycle events, annotating spans with metadata, and recording metrics or logs during distributed tracing.",

It allows creating and managing subscribers that capture trace data through customizable callbacks for span lifecycle, metadata attachment, and logging, while leveraging buffer pooling to reduce allocation overhead during high-throughput streaming. You can use it to build custom trace exporters that process span events in real-time or to integrate diagnostic tools that capture structured logs and metrics. The combined interface supports both direct subscriber control and fine-grained event handling through its callback and buffer management submodules.",

It enables setting up trace subscribers, collectors, and scoped trace handling, with direct control over trace formatting and destination. Child modules provide JSON serialization of low-level events, including durations, counters, and spans, along with exporters that write JSONL or arrays to streams or buffers. You can use it to capture structured trace data in-memory, stream it to files or network endpoints, or integrate with analysis tools via customizable serialization and buffering strategies.",
