      "description": "This module handles key-value operations on a map structured with tuples of IP addresses and ports as keys, enabling efficient management of network-related bindings. It supports ordered traversal, filtering, and transformation of these mappings, along with bulk operations like list-based additions and merging. Use cases include maintaining routing tables, tracking active sessions, or managing port-forwarding configurations where precise IP-port associations are critical.",

Operates on types such as IP addresses, Cstruct.t for packet data, and custom error types. Used to establish and manage UDP connections, route packets, and send data with controlled network parameters like TTL.",

It works with network flows, IP addresses, ports, and a type `t` for managing connection states, supporting buffered or nodelay writes and error reporting. Use cases include building reliable networked applications, streaming data, or implementing custom protocols requiring precise flow control.",
