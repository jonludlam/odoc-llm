      "description": "This module implements a polymorphic map with `(Ipaddr.t * int)` keys, enabling efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations alongside bulk transformations like `merge` and `union`. It emphasizes ordered traversal, filtering, and persistence through immutable updates, supporting conversions to sequences, lists, and range-based iterations. Designed for network-centric applications, it excels in scenarios like DNS session tracking or connection state management where IP/port pairs require structured, ordered key handling.",

      "description": "This module combines DNS communication primitives over TCP and UDP with a specialized map structure for managing IP and port associations. It enables sending and receiving DNS messages with precise control over network endpoints, while the map submodule supports efficient, ordered manipulation of connection states using `(Ipaddr.t * int)` keys. Use it to build MirageOS-based DNS resolvers or servers that track sessions and manage concurrent connections with structured, immutable state updates. The combined functionality facilitates low-level network handling alongside high-performance, ordered key-value operations tailored for DNS-related tasks.",
