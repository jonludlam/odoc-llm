It works with `LevelDB.writebatch` to collect operations, and interacts directly with `LevelDB.db` when writing the batch. Concrete use cases include efficiently applying multiple updates or deletions to a database without intermediate states being visible.",

It provides functions to retrieve, check existence, and iterate over key-value pairs as they existed at the snapshot's creation. Use cases include atomic reads across multiple keys, consistent backups, and long-running scans without interference from concurrent writes.",

It supports operations like moving to the first or last key, seeking to a specific key, and stepping through bindings one at a time. Use cases include scanning all entries in a database, paginating through results, or processing a subset of keys starting from a given point.",

It operates on string keys and values, with functions for retrieving values optionally, checking membership, and iterating in both directions, either from the start or a specific key. Concrete use cases include fetching stored records, scanning key ranges, and validating data presence without modifying the database.",

      "description": "This module provides access to LevelDB databases, offering a comprehensive interface for managing and querying key-value data with support for atomic operations, snapshots, and ordered traversal. It includes `writebatch` for grouping multiple updates and deletions into atomic writes, `snapshot` for consistent reads over a fixed database state, and `iterator` for efficiently traversing key-value pairs in lexicographic order. Direct operations allow single-key lookups, existence checks, and iteration, enabling tasks like record retrieval, key-range scans, and data validation. Together, these features support complex workflows such as transactional updates, point-in-time backups, and paginated result processing.",
