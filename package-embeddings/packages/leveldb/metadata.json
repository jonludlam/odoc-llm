It works with `LevelDB.writebatch` to collect operations and `LevelDB.db` to apply them. Concrete use cases include efficiently updating large numbers of key-value pairs or performing atomic deletions and inserts without intermediate states being visible.",

It works with string keys and values, exposing functions that support precise queries and scans. Concrete use cases include fetching specific records, checking key presence, and streaming data in lexicographic order or from a given starting point.",

It supports operations like positioning the iterator at a specific key, retrieving the current key and value, and scanning through the database. Concrete use cases include efficiently traversing large datasets, implementing range queries, and processing data in sorted order without loading the entire database into memory.",

It supports key-value lookups, existence checks, and iteration over the snapshot using both forward and reverse scans, starting optionally from a specific key. Use cases include atomic reads across multiple keys, consistent backups, and long-running scans unaffected by concurrent writes.",

It supports atomic batch writes, consistent snapshots for isolated reads, and range compaction to optimize storage, alongside metadata queries and comparator customization, making it suitable for applications requiring efficient ordered data management, such as caching systems, logging infrastructures, or embedded databases with atomic update needs.",
