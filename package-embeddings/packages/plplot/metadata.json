      "description": "The module provides low-level operations for creating and managing 2D plot streams, including drawing shapes, setting colors, defining axes, and handling coordinate transformations, while working with numerical data, graphical parameters, and structures like `plot_t`, `legend_entry_t`, and `colorbar_kind_t`. It enables precise control over visual elements such as line styles, text placement, and color palettes, supporting tasks like scientific visualization and custom plot layouts. Specific use cases include rendering detailed graphical representations, managing legends and colorbars, and configuring complex 2D visualizations with fine-grained adjustments.",
