      "description": "This module supports creating and rendering 2D visualizations through operations like configuring plot streams, drawing geometric primitives (arcs, polygons, contours, images), and managing layout elements (legends, colorbars, subpages). It works with data structures representing plot streams, coordinate systems, color models, and layout specifications such as `legend_entry_t` or `layout_t`. The functionality enables use cases like scientific data visualization with custom axes, annotated plots with text and symbols, and complex multi-panel layouts with device-specific rendering options.",

It operates on float arrays and lists of coordinate pairs, suitable for quick data exploration or debugging. Concrete use cases include plotting sensor data traces, image matrices with color scales, and function graphs for numerical simulations.",

      "description": "This module enables the creation and customization of 2D and 3D scientific plots such as line plots, histograms, mesh plots, and geospatial visualizations. It provides core operations for configuring plot streams, rendering geometric primitives, and managing layout elements like legends and colorbars, working with data types such as `legend_entry_t` and `layout_t`. Submodules streamline rapid visualization of float arrays and coordinate lists, supporting tasks like plotting sensor data, image matrices, and function graphs. Together, the module and its submodules offer both fine-grained control over rendering and high-level functions for quick data exploration.",
