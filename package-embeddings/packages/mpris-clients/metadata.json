It works with `OBus_proxy.t` to interact with media players over D-Bus, exposing properties such as identity, desktop entry, and supported URI schemes or MIME types. Concrete use cases include integrating with desktop environments to manage playback applications like Spotify or VLC through standardized MPRIS interfaces.",
