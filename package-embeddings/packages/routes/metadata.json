Works directly with string paths and a structured representation of route segments. Useful for defining and matching URL routes in web applications without relying on a specific framework.",

It works with string-based paths and structured route segments, enabling type-safe navigation and bidirectional routing for applications requiring precise URL schema enforcement or debuggable route introspection. Use cases include building RESTful APIs with validated path parameters, generating URIs from route definitions, and inspecting routing tables during development.",
