      "description": "This module provides combinators for building typed route patterns that extract and validate URL path segments as specific types or match exact strings. It supports operations to format routes as strings, merge route sets, and inspect their structure, ensuring type-safe web endpoints with statically verified URL parameters. Child modules handle low-level path parsing and matching, enabling construction of route components from strings, prefix extraction, and wildcard matching. Examples include parsing numeric IDs or boolean flags from API paths and defining structured, composable routes independent of any web framework.",
