It supports operations like `write` for transmitting data to a specified destination, `listen` to register callbacks for incoming packets on a port, and `input` to route received datagrams to the appropriate listener. The module works with IP addresses represented as `Ipaddr.t`, uses `Cstruct.t` for packet data, and manages asynchronous I/O via `Lwt.t`.",

It operates on `flow` types representing individual TCP connections and `t` values encapsulating the TCP/IP stack instance, working with network packet buffers and IP address types. These capabilities support use cases such as building TCP servers, implementing reliable communication channels, and integrating packet processing pipelines in MirageOS network stacks.",

      "description": "This module coordinates a dual IPv4/IPv6 networking stack, enabling the creation of network services that handle UDP, TCP, and raw IP traffic across both protocols. It provides descriptors for transport-layer communication, supports connection teardown, packet demultiplexing, and asynchronous I/O handling through Lwt, while integrating IP layer management for addressing, fragmentation, and MTU control. The IP submodule routes incoming packets by protocol, sends IP frames with proper headers, and manages address configuration, while the UDP and TCP submodules offer datagram transmission, port-based listeners, connection establishment, and stream-based data transfer. Example uses include setting up a TCP server that accepts IPv4 and IPv6 connections, sending UDP datagrams with explicit addressing, or processing raw IP packets with custom protocol handlers.",

It works with data types like `backend`, `Ipaddr.V4.Prefix.t`, and `Cstruct.t`, enabling setup of virtual network interfaces with monitoring and custom packet handling. The backend module manages virtual devices by handle, allowing packet writes, receive handlers, and MAC address control, useful for implementing MirageOS network backends or directing traffic between interfaces. The networking stack module extends this with dual IPv4/IPv6 support, handling UDP, TCP, and raw IP traffic through Lwt-based I/O, with concrete uses including TCP servers accepting both IP versions and custom protocol handlers for raw packets.",
