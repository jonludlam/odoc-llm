      "description": "This module implements a bidirectional interface for initializing and disposing of resources, using two functions: one to create a value within a monadic context and another to finalize it. It operates on monadic types `'a M.t` and pairs them with an `'a -> unit M.t` disposal function, encapsulating both in an `'a Oprev.t` structure. It is useful for managing resources like file handles or network connections where setup and teardown actions must be explicitly paired.",

Concrete use cases include managing resource-safe I/O operations and sequencing asynchronous or error-prone processes with guaranteed finalization.",
