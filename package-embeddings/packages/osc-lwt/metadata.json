      "description": "This module provides UDP-based networking for Open Sound Control (OSC) communication, enabling both transmission and reception of OSC packets over a network. The client component allows creating instances to send packets to specified socket addresses, while the server component supports receiving packets along with their source information. Key operations include initializing and releasing client and server instances, sending OSC messages from a client, and capturing incoming OSC data on a server. For example, a client can send a timestamped audio event to a remote server, and a server can listen for and process OSC messages from multiple sources in real-time.",
