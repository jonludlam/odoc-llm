It operates on sets of ordered elements, enabling deterministic traversal, efficient membership checks, and conversion to or from lists and sequences. This structure is particularly useful for applications requiring precise manipulation of path attributes, such as file system analysis tools or configuration managers that track hierarchical metadata.",

      "description": "This module provides core file system interaction capabilities, including directory traversal, file search, creation, and copying, with support for customizable directory walks and filename rewriting. It works with `Fpath.t` paths and offers error-resilient operations for managing hierarchical structures and implementing file discovery logic. The child module extends this functionality by providing immutable ordered sets for precise manipulation of file path metadata, enabling efficient membership checks and deterministic traversal. Together, they support use cases like analyzing directory trees, tracking hierarchical metadata, and performing structured file system transformations.",
