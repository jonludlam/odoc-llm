It supports iterative transformations, filtering, and reverse-order traversal of path attributes, enabling efficient manipulation of structured data sequences. Use cases include managing hierarchical path metadata or optimizing data processing pipelines requiring ordered set operations.",

It supports filtering, combining, and traversing elements in reverse order, with operations based on `Ord.compare` for ordering. Examples include organizing hierarchical path metadata or refining data processing pipelines by manipulating ordered collections. Key data types include sets and path attributes, with operations like add, remove, filter, and reverse.",
