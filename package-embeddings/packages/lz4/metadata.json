It operates on values of type `storage`, which represents raw byte sequences, and includes operations to compress data into a target buffer, decompress from a buffer to another, and handle errors for invalid or corrupted inputs. Concrete use cases include efficient compression of large binary datasets and decompression of LZ4-encoded streams with strict size constraints.",

Key operations include compressing raw data into a smaller representation and reconstructing the original data from compressed input, all optimized for speed and efficiency. It is ideal for use in network communication, file storage, and streaming applications where fast, lightweight compression is required. For example, you can compress a byte array representing a message before sending it over a socket or decompress a block of stored data into a buffer for processing.",
