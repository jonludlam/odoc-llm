      "description": "This module provides set operations for managing collections of elements, including algebraic operations like union, intersection, and difference, as well as ordered manipulations such as retrieving minimum/maximum elements and splitting sets based on predicates. It works with elements of a generic type `elt` stored in a set type `t` that relies on a comparison function for ordering. Use cases include efficiently managing hierarchical path structures or querying structured data with ordered constraints.",

It works with structured data where keys are ordered, enabling functions like `find`, `split`, and `map` to manipulate bindings or transform values. Use cases include configuration management, where dynamic key-based lookups and updates are required, or data processing pipelines needing efficient key-value transformations.",
