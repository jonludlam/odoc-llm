It works with GraphQL variables, WebSocket data frames, and result handlers, offering operations to register subscriptions, process messages, and manage active streams. The child module extends this by tracking and coordinating live subscription states, allowing clients to maintain and terminate real-time data flows with custom subscription types. Together, they enable a GraphQL server to support reactive, bidirectional communication over WebSockets for events like live updates and streaming queries.",
