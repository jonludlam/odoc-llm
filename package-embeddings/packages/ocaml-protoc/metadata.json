It includes accessors for retrieving field properties like name, number, type, and options, as well as utilities for working with messages, enums, and type scopes. Concrete use cases include extracting default values from fields, querying message or enum options by name, and resolving types by their identifiers during code generation or schema processing.",

It provides structured data handling through submodules for options, lists, and maps (string and integer keyed), supporting operations like filtering, mapping, merging, and ordered traversal. Use cases include parsing and processing protobuf definitions, managing configuration data with fallbacks, and building or transforming structured collections with deterministic ordering and error resilience.",
