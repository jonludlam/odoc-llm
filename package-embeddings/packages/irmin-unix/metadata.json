      "description": "This module implements a RESTful HTTP interface for interacting with Irmin repositories, enabling both server and client operations over HTTP. It provides server configuration with strict header control and uses Cohttp for handling connections, while exposing client-side functionality for remote repository access, including path management, atomic updates, branch merging, and commit serialization. Core data types include repository handles, commit and node keys, branch values, and hash identifiers, supporting operations like `mem`, `find`, `add`, `set`, `fetch`, and `push`. You can serve repository contents over HTTP, connect to remote repositories, export data slices, construct commits with metadata, and perform content-aware merges for distributed version control and collaborative editing.",

It supports typed key-value operations, path-based hierarchical addressing, and cryptographic hashes, with core operations including atomic updates, membership checks, versioned writes, and branch-aware merges. You can build persistent, concurrent state stores, version-controlled configuration systems, and distributed log appenders with structured file layouts and crash-safe writes. Submodules refine this with custom path encodings, commit metadata tracking, conflict resolution strategies, and cryptographic integrity verification.",

It provides stores for versioned key-value data, hierarchical nodes, commits with timestamps and authors, and networked access via HTTP and GraphQL, supporting operations like atomic writes, merges, `fetch`, `push`, and remote repository resolution. You can build persistent versioned stores backed by the filesystem or Git, serve and query repository contents over HTTP or GraphQL, and manage repository configuration and commands through a typed CLI interface. Core data types include commit graphs, hash-identified objects, hierarchical trees, and typed configurations that enable workflows like distributed version control, remote state synchronization, and structured command-line tools.",
