It supports operations to create collation elements with specified weights, check if an element is variable, determine ignorable weight levels, and append encoded weights to a buffer. Use cases include implementing custom string comparison logic and handling linguistic sorting rules with multi-level collation.",

It works with sequences of collation elements or Unicode characters to produce compact byte strings that preserve collation order. These keys enable efficient sorting and equality checks for strings under custom collation rules, such as case-insensitive or locale-specific ordering.",

It supports registering and inferring collation rules, then comparing strings accordingly\u2014such as sorting French or Swedish text with correct character ordering. Child modules handle Unicode-to-collation element mapping, collation element representation as weighted vectors, and generation of comparable byte keys for efficient sorting. Together, they enable tasks like localizing application text sorting, implementing custom linguistic rules, and optimizing string comparisons across diverse datasets.",

Works with string data and applies transformations defined in the collation mapping to ensure consistent ordering and equivalence checks.
