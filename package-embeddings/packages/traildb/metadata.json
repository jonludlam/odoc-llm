Operates on custom types representing literals, disjunctions, and conjunctions to define complex filtering logic. Used to construct event-based rules in systems requiring conditional data processing.",

Enables constructing complex conditions with logical conjunctions and literals to refine event selection. Allows building precise filters, iterating over trails, and efficiently appending data to structured time-series stores.",
