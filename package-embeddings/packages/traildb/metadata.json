It supports operations to retrieve the next or current event in a trail, get the length of the trail, and navigate through trails using a cursor. Concrete use cases include processing event streams sequentially, analyzing user behavior trails, and extracting specific event data from large datasets.",

It works with TrailDB's internal item representations to filter events based on exact field value conditions. Concrete use cases include selecting events where specific fields match or exclude certain values, such as tracking user activity with particular attributes or excluding known patterns from query results.",

It works with data structures such as events, fields, UUIDs, timestamps, and trail-to-identifier mappings, while supporting error handling for robust data processing. It is suited for use cases like real-time analytics, log processing, or system monitoring where structured event streams require low-latency querying and aggregation.",
