It works directly with `Sid.sub_auths` and returns fully formed `Sid.t` values. These constructors are used to represent standard security identifiers like the null SID, world SID, NT authority SIDs, and mandatory labels in access control and security contexts.",

It directly supports working with `Sid.t` values, including domain-specific SIDs like `S-1-5-21-...-constant_suffix` and fixed authorities such as `S-1-5-32` (built-in groups) and `S-1-18` (security roles), enabling tasks like access control configuration and role assignment. Child modules offer specialized constructors for SIDs under well-known identifier authorities such as `S-1-0`, `S-1-1`, and `S-1-5`, allowing precise creation of standard SIDs by appending sub-authorities to form complete `Sid.t` values. Examples include generating the null SID (`S-1-0-0`), the local system SID (`S-1-5-18`), or built-in administrator group SIDs (`S-1-5-32-544`).",
