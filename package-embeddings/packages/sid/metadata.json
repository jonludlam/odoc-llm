It operates directly on `Sid.t` values, decoding from and encoding to raw bytes, with explicit support for reading and writing SIDs in binary protocols or file formats. Concrete use cases include parsing SIDs from network packets or Windows binary structures and emitting them in low-level system interactions where exact byte layout matters.",

It operates on `Sid.t` values and utilizes 32-bit unsigned integers to represent domain or machine identifiers when generating SIDs for dynamic contexts. These capabilities are primarily used in access control, authentication, and security context management within Windows environments.",
