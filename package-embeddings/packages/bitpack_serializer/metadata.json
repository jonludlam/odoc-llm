It supports basic types like integers (signed, unsigned, arbitrary precision), strings, and bytes, as well as composite types through pairing and sum types. Use cases include structured binary data encoding, protocol definition, and efficient buffer manipulation for network or storage formats.",

It supports dictionary-based compression to replace repeated strings with compact references, optimizing storage efficiency, and includes utilities for analyzing bit distribution in serialized data, making it suitable for compact binary encoding and high-performance data transmission scenarios.",
