It processes binary data streams, supporting variable-length and fixed-length data handling, and includes tools for analyzing bit statistics, making it suitable for optimizing network protocols or storage formats.",

Enables composition of lenses for pairs and disjunctive types, allowing structured data to be encoded and decoded efficiently.
