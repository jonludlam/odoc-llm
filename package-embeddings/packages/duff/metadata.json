It works with `bigstring` data types to efficiently handle large byte sequences and generates a list of `hunk` operations\u2014`Copy` and `Insert`\u2014that describe how to reconstruct a target buffer from a source. Concrete use cases include binary file differencing, incremental backups, and efficient data synchronization.",
