Works with byte arrays, integers, and bitmasks to handle low-level data formatting.

Supports variables, wildcards, and non-linear pattern matching using S-expressions and atoms. Can apply rules to streams of facts, track partial matches, and handle errors with contextual feedback. Examples include matching memory access patterns, inferring program behavior, and generating derived facts from raw binary data.",
