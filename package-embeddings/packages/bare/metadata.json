It supports operations to load rules from strings or files, inspect rule components (left-hand and right-hand sides), and apply rules incrementally to facts, producing new facts and updated matching states. It is used to implement non-linear pattern matching in a forward-chaining rule engine, where rules bind variables across multiple patterns and generate output facts upon full match.",

      "description": "This module processes streams of S-expression facts using a forward-chaining rule engine that supports non-linear pattern matching and variable binding across patterns. It allows rules to be defined as pairs of pattern tuples (left-hand side) and output fact tuples (right-hand side), enabling declarative specification of analysis logic for tasks like memory allocator behavior detection. The core functionality includes rule application over fact streams, variable constraint enforcement, and fact generation upon full pattern match. Submodules handle rule parsing, transformation, and incremental application, supporting operations to load, inspect, and apply rules while maintaining matching state across events.",
