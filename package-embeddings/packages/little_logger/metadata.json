The module provides `of_string` for parsing logging levels from strings and `to_string` for converting them back, enabling configuration via command-line arguments or config files. Useful for controlling log verbosity in applications or filtering log output based on severity.",

      "description": "This module provides core logging functionality with support for multiple severity levels, including trace, debug, info, error, and more. It allows logging via direct strings or lazy thunks, and supports custom printers and log level thresholds. The Level submodule defines the `t` type for representing log levels, with utilities to convert to and from strings, enabling dynamic configuration of logging verbosity. Users can set the log level from a command-line argument, filter messages based on severity, and customize output behavior while logging messages conditionally based on importance.",

It supports logging messages at various severity levels, including trace, debug, info, and error, with options to log directly or lazily, filter by log level, and customize output. Timestamps can be formatted into human-readable strings following RFC 3339, including proper timezone offsets. Example usage includes logging an info message with a timestamp or conditionally printing error messages based on configured verbosity.",
