It supports two main operations: `promises`, which sets the current process's promises, and `execpromises`, which sets promises for future exec calls. Use cases include sandboxing network services or reducing privileges before executing untrusted code.",

It allows specifying file paths and permitted operations (e.g., read, write), then locks further changes to enforce the defined access policy. Typical use includes restricting a process to only access specific files or directories, enhancing security by limiting exposure to unintended file operations.",

It provides operations to set promises for system call limitations and to define read/write access to specific files or directories. For example, a network service can be sandboxed to only access its configuration and log files, or a process can drop privileges before executing untrusted code.",
