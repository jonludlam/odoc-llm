It supports constructing intervals from bounds and values, converting to and from triplet representations, and handling range-based operations. This enables efficient storage and querying of data tied to numerical ranges, such as time-based events or labeled intervals. Examples include tracking scheduled tasks within time slots or associating metadata with numeric segments.",
