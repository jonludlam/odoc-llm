It includes operations to construct, query, and manipulate intervals using floating-point bounds and associated values, enabling efficient range-based lookups. The tree can be used to find all intervals overlapping a specific time or numerical value, such as identifying conflicting time slots in scheduling or overlapping DNA segments in genomics. Submodule functions allow direct interval creation and conversion from tuples, supporting flexible data input and extraction for numerical range queries and segment-based processing.",
