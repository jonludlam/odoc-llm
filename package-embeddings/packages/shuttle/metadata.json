It includes a function to convert these result values into S-expressions. This is used to handle and log outcomes of network or I/O operations in a structured format.",

It works with TCP sockets and wraps input/output channels for data transmission, handling connection lifecycle events like timeouts, errors, and shutdowns. Concrete use cases include building network servers that process incoming requests and clients that communicate with remote services over TCP.",

It works with file descriptors and integrates with async pipes for streaming data transfer, exposing a view of buffered content as slices. Use cases include implementing custom network protocol parsers, handling large file reads with controlled memory usage, and bridging low-level file descriptors with high-level async pipelines.",

It operates on output channel objects with customizable buffer sizes and reports flush outcomes via dedicated result types, integrating deferred computations for asynchronous coordination. Typical applications include high-performance I/O pipelines, log aggregation systems, and network protocol implementations requiring precise flow control and error resilience.",

It operates on bigstrings through the `t` type, enabling zero-copy slicing, unsafe indexing, and appending of diverse byte-oriented data like strings, bytes, or other buffers, making it ideal for high-performance networking, binary serialization, and low-level data processing where efficient memory handling is critical.",
