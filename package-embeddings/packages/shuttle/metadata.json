It includes a function to convert the result type to an S-expression for serialization or debugging. Use this module to handle and inspect outcomes of asynchronous flush operations in networked or I/O-bound applications.",

It defines a result type for flush operations, indicating success, remote closure, or error, and includes utilities to convert these results to S-expressions for debugging or serialization. You can use it to build reliable, non-blocking output systems with configurable timeouts and error recovery, particularly in network services or logging pipelines that require inspection and handling of flush outcomes.",

It provides both safe interfaces for stream-based data accumulation and unsafe low-level access for direct memory manipulation via slices and indexing. Typical applications include network protocol implementations, binary file processing, and systems programming tasks requiring precise control over byte sequences and memory layout.",

It works with TCP sockets and wraps input/output operations through `Input_channel` and `Output_channel` abstractions, handling connection lifecycle and error propagation. Concrete use cases include building TCP-based network services that require asynchronous handling of incoming connections and clients, such as HTTP servers or custom network protocols.",

It provides operations to create, refill, consume, and close input channels, along with utilities to transfer data between channels and pipes. Concrete use cases include streaming data from network sockets, reading large files in chunks, and managing input buffers in event-driven servers.",
