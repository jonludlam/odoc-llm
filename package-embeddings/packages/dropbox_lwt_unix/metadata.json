It handles user information, file and folder metadata, shared folder states, sync cursors, and streaming content, supporting cross-device sync, collaborative sharing, and large file handling with version control. The OAuth2 submodule manages authorization flows, token exchange, and URI-based code extraction, allowing secure user authentication and token acquisition for API access. Example uses include syncing user files across devices, managing shared folders with access controls, and streaming large file uploads with resumable transfers.",
