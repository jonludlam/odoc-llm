It works with a custom type `t` to represent saved states, with `save` capturing the current state and `restore` reverting to a previously saved state. This is useful for implementing undo/redo functionality in applications like interactive editors or stateful simulations, where precise control over state changes is required.",

      "description": "This module implements timed references with support for undo/redo operations using an abstract timeline. It provides standard reference operations (`ref`, `!`, `:=`, `incr`, `decr`) with minimal overhead, along with time-aware functions like `pure_apply` and `pure_test` to control state transitions. The Time submodule manages the timeline, offering `save` to capture and `restore` to revert to previous states, enabling precise rollback in interactive systems like editors or debuggers. For example, a user can increment a reference, save the time point, and later restore the reference to its previous value.",

      "description": "This module extends standard reference operations with time-based state tracking, enabling atomic-like updates and selective rollbacks using saved time points. It introduces functions to modify references while maintaining a history of changes, which can be reverted using the `save` and `restore` operations provided by its child module. The primary data type is `Stdlib.ref` augmented with internal state tracking, alongside an abstract time point type `t` used to mark and return to specific update points. You can use it to implement transactional logic in mutable code, such as speculative computations with controlled backtracking or undo systems for reference changes.",
