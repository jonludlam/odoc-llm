Use cases include implementing undo/redo functionality in interactive applications or rolling back state changes during debugging and testing.",

      "description": "This module implements timed references with support for undo/redo operations through an abstract timeline. It provides reference operations such as `ref`, `!`, `:=`, `incr`, and `decr`, which behave like standard references but track changes over time. The `Time` submodule allows saving and restoring the state of references, enabling features like transactional updates, interactive undo/redo in editors, or speculative execution in debuggers. Additional functions like `pure_apply` and `pure_test` allow controlled execution of functions with automatic state rollback based on the result.",
