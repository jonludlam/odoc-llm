It uses an abstract type `t` to represent saved states and operates with constant time for saving, while restoration time depends on the number of intervening changes.

Supports operations to record, revert, and navigate through changes, enabling actions like undoing configuration updates or rolling back variable assignments. Provides functions to capture the current state, revert to a prior state, and manage a timeline of modifications. Example uses include reverting a series of user input changes or restoring a system to a known stable configuration.",

It defines an abstract type `t` for saved states and offers operations to save and restore these states, with saving occurring in constant time and restoration proportional to the number of changes. Users can implement reversible execution, version control, or state rollback in applications. For example, a program can save a state before a critical operation and revert to it if an error occurs.",
