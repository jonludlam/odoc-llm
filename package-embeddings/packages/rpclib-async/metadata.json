Works with `box`, `resultb`, and `rpcfn` types to manage asynchronous results and RPC responses. Supports direct access to deferred values and conversion between deferreds and boxed values.",

Works with the `resultb` type, which represents computations that can either succeed with a value or fail with an error. Used to manage error propagation in parsing, validation, and stateful computations where failure must be explicitly handled at each step.",

It works with OCaml function types, parameter descriptions, and error-handling structures to construct asynchronous client interfaces.

Supports operations on `box`, `resultb`, and `rpcfn` types to sequence deferred actions, handle failures, and structure RPC calls. Enables defining typed RPC methods, converting between deferred and boxed values, and managing error flows in asynchronous workflows. Examples include parsing JSON responses, chaining async validation steps, and implementing client-server communication with structured data exchange.",
