It works with function types built using `fn`, `@->`, and `returning` to define RPC calls that return deferred results, along with supporting notifications via `declare_notification`. Concrete use cases include generating type-safe async clients for JSON-RPC services based on interface descriptions.",

It works with boxed values wrapping deferred results, supporting operations like `bind`, `return`, and `get` to chain and extract asynchronous computations.

It provides core types like `client_implementation`, `server_implementation`, and the RPC function type in `T`, allowing multiple RPC endpoints to be combined and executed as a single service. The child modules handle client construction, monadic composition of deferred computations, result chaining, and server method declaration, supporting workflows such as defining RPC interfaces with `fn` and `@->`, implementing async handlers with `bind` and `deferred`, and handling errors via `resultb`. Example usage includes building a JSON-RPC server that handles multiple typed endpoints and composes client requests with asynchronous error handling and deferred result extraction.",
