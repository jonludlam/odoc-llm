It supports retrieving the current time zone offset in seconds and the clock's period in days and picoseconds, enabling accurate time measurements and adjustments. Concrete use cases include timestamping events with high precision, calculating time intervals, and synchronizing clocks across distributed systems.",

Works with 64-bit integers to represent time values. Useful for precise timing measurements in virtualized environments, such as profiling code execution or tracking event durations.",
