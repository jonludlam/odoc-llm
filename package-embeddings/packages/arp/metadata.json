Operates on types such as Macaddr.t, Cstruct.t, and custom error types. Used to construct and process Ethernet packets, route incoming traffic based on protocol, and cleanly disconnect from the network layer.",

Processes ARP packets to resolve hardware addresses from IP addresses in networked environments. Used in network stack implementations to facilitate communication between devices on the same local network.",

Works with Ethernet and IPv4 ARP frames represented as a record type and error variants. Decodes byte buffers into frames, encodes frames into new buffers, and checks frame equality.",
