      "description": "This module implements an ARP layer that manages IP-to-MAC address resolution, supporting operations to add, remove, and query IP addresses, as well as handle incoming ARP frames. It works with `Ipaddr.V4.t` for IP addresses, `Macaddr.t` for MAC addresses, and uses `Cstruct.t` for frame input handling. Concrete use cases include responding to ARP requests, sending GARP packets when IP bindings change, and maintaining an address cache for network communication over Ethernet.",

It provides functions to manage a list of bound IP addresses, send GARP packets on changes, and query or update the ARP cache. Operations include adding, removing, or querying IP-MAC mappings, handling incoming ARP frames, and disconnecting from the ARP layer.",

It processes incoming ARP frames, sends requests and responses, and handles GARP packets when IP bindings change, using `Ipaddr.V4.t`, `Macaddr.t`, and `Cstruct.t` for frame handling. It works with network interfaces and Ethernet frames to establish and maintain connectivity in local networks, enabling tasks like responding to ARP queries and updating address bindings dynamically.",

It supports operations to query, update, and remove cache entries, process incoming ARP packets, generate ARP requests and replies, and handle timeouts and retries for unresolved queries. Concrete use cases include network stack implementations where IPv4 address resolution over Ethernet is required, such as in TCP/IP stacks or virtual networking components.",
