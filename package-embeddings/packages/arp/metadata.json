It supports creating and modifying static and dynamic ARP entries, handling incoming ARP packets, generating replies, and sending gratuitous ARP frames. Concrete use cases include resolving IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses for network communication, managing ARP cache timeouts and retries, and handling ARP queries with customizable merge logic.",

It supports parsing raw data into typed ARP packets, including error handling for malformed input, and serializing packets into network-ready bytes. Use cases include network stack implementations and packet analysis tools where ARP messages must be constructed or inspected.",

It allows binding and unbinding IPv4 addresses, sending and responding to ARP requests, and querying resolved MAC addresses while handling GARP packets on IP changes. Use cases include configuring virtual interfaces with multiple IPs, resolving MAC addresses for network communication, and managing ARP responses in a network stack.",
