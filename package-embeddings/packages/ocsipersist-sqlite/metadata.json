It allows querying, inserting, modifying, and removing entries, as well as batch and range-based iteration, making it suitable for managing structured data like user sessions or cached results. The child module extends this functionality by implementing named persistent variables that support default value initialization, both synchronously and asynchronously, enabling robust handling of configuration settings or cached data with fallback. Together, they offer a cohesive interface for durable, typed storage with flexible access patterns and initialization semantics.",
