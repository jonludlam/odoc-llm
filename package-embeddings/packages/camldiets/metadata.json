      "description": "This module provides set-theoretic operations (union, intersection, difference), element transformations (mapping, filtering), and ordered traversal capabilities for immutable sets parameterized by an ordered type. It works with sets whose elements are compared and ordered using a provided `compare` function, supporting bulk conversions to/from lists and sequences, subset iteration, and size-aware operations. Specific use cases include managing sorted collections with efficient membership queries, implementing algorithms requiring ordered set intersections, and processing hierarchical data through recursive set partitioning.",
