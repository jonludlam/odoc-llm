      "description": "This module implements finite sets with ordered elements, supporting creation, modification through union/intersection/difference operations, and safe accessors returning optional values. It relies on a custom ordered type for element comparison and maintains sets as balanced trees with unique, sorted elements. Key use cases include data processing pipelines requiring ordered iteration, bulk conversion between sets and sequences/lists, and applications needing efficient membership checks, subset relations, or tree-height analysis for performance tuning.",

It includes a concrete implementation for integers, allowing precise tracking of nutritional values or ingredient quantities. Submodules provide ordered finite sets for efficient membership checks and bulk conversions, along with basic integer operations for step-wise traversal and distance calculations. Together, they support dietary analysis workflows involving range iteration, set operations, and ordered data validation.",
