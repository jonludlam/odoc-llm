It manages pixel data arrays, rectangle coordinates, and transformation flags to enable precise image processing tasks such as resizing, cropping, and format adaptation. Operations include modifying frame dimensions, applying transformations, and converting between pixel formats. Examples include optimizing video streams for different resolutions or encoding standards by adjusting frame properties dynamically.",
