It defines a resource type for external assets and supports equality, hashing, and disposal to ensure proper cleanup. Operations include creating, referencing, and releasing resources, with examples like managing file handles or network sockets across concurrent tasks. The module enforces correct lifecycle management to prevent leaks in multi-threaded environments.",
