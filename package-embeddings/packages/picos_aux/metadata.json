It supports concurrent `push` and `push_head` operations for multiple producers, and exclusive `pop_exn` and `pop_all` operations for the single consumer. The queue is ideal for managing runnable tasks in a fair, FIFO single-threaded scheduler.",

It supports constant-time push and pop operations at both ends of the queue, with explicit handling for empty states via exceptions. The queue is designed for use in building fair, FIFO-oriented schedulers where threads manage shared or local queues to minimize contention.",

It provides operations to create, increment, and decrement reference counts, along with unsafe access to the underlying resource and introspection into reference count state. This module is used when safely transferring ownership of disposable resources like file handles or network connections between concurrent execution contexts.",

It provides operations to increment, decrement, and query reference counts, ensuring resources are only disposed of when no longer referenced. Concrete use cases include managing file handles, memory buffers, or network connections that must be released after use.",

It provides atomic operations like `try_add`, `try_set`, `try_compare_and_set`, and `try_remove` for modifying bindings, along with lookup and removal functions that return results directly or raise exceptions when keys are absent. It is suitable for building scalable concurrent data structures where thread coordination must avoid locks, such as in distributed systems coordination layers or high-performance shared caches.",
