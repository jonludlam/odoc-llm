      "description": "This module implements a lock-free multi-producer, single-consumer queue optimized for use as a fair ready queue in a single-threaded scheduler. It supports constant-time push operations to both the head and tail of the queue, and provides atomic pop operations for the consumer, returning values in FIFO order. The queue is designed for high-throughput task scheduling where producers from multiple threads can enqueue work items and a single thread processes them in order.",

It defines a core resource type with equality, hashing, and release operations, and builds on this with reference-counted wrappers and global tracking tables that support concurrent access. Operations include incrementing and decrementing counts, querying metadata, and inspecting active entries, enabling safe handling of shared file descriptors, network connections, and memory buffers. Specific use cases include tracking lifecycle of OS resources across domains and managing concurrent access to external handles with automatic cleanup on last release.",

It supports operations to create a queue, push values to the tail or head, pop values from the head (raising an exception if empty), and query the length or emptiness of the queue. Concrete use cases include building ready queues for fair fiber scheduling, where threads push tasks locally and steal from other threads' queues when idle.",

Concrete use cases include coordinating shared state in concurrent systems, implementing distributed agreement protocols, and managing dynamic mappings in multi-threaded environments without locks.",
