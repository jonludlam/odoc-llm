      "description": "This module organizes and displays structured documentation for command collections, using `t` values to represent help content that can be rendered as Vdom nodes. It supports creating and merging command documentation, with core operations to convert command lists into formatted help displays. The command help entries pair keystrokes with descriptions and allow customization of layout and styling through child modules. For example, you can define a command with a keyboard shortcut, format its display with custom CSS spans, and integrate it into a web UI help menu with structured layout.",

It supports operations like merging handlers, filtering events based on DOM targets, and generating help text from keybindings, enabling use cases such as contextual shortcuts and disabled key suppression. Core data types include `Command` for key-triggered actions and `Disabled_key` for blocking default input, while conditions allow fine-grained control over event routing. Submodules provide utilities for composing event matchers, defining command metadata, and implementing UI-specific keyboard behaviors.",
