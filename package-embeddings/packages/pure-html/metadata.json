      "description": "This module offers functions for constructing HTML attributes and tags, handling diverse value types such as strings, booleans, integers, and enumerated values, with suffixes like `_` or `to_attr` to resolve naming conflicts between attributes and tags. It supports precise manipulation of elements like form fields, styling properties, and event handlers, while addressing edge cases such as text content preservation in tags like `style` or `script`, and semantic HTML structures. Use cases include generating valid DOM structures, managing conditional attributes, and ensuring type-safe interactions with HTML syntax.",
