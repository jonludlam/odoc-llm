      "description": "This module provides functions to construct and manipulate MathML elements and attributes for rendering mathematical notation in HTML. It works with standard HTML attributes and tags, offering direct mappings to MathML XML syntax through element constructors like `mfrac`, `msup`, and `mtable`, as well as attributes such as `displaystyle` and `linethickness`. These tools are used to embed structured mathematical expressions, including equations, matrices, and annotated formulas, directly into HTML output without framework dependencies.",

      "description": "This module enables type-safe construction of HTML elements and attributes using OCaml values, focusing on form handling, media controls, and accessibility features. It operates on polymorphic variants, strings, integers, and specialized types like `std_tag` and `void_tag` to represent standard/self-closing tags, supporting use cases like dynamic form generation, interactive UI components, and semantic HTML structures. Attributes such as `action`, `role`, and `src` are modeled with typed values to ensure correctness, while tags like `div`, `input`, and `table` follow a consistent pattern for programmatic HTML assembly.",

      "description": "This module provides functions to construct and manipulate RSS feed structures by converting string and integer values into RSS-specific elements and attributes like `pub_date`, `guid`, and `enclosure`. It defines typed representations of RSS tags (e.g., `item`, `channel`, `title`) as distinct values, enabling programmatic generation of valid RSS feeds with metadata and nested content. Typical use cases include generating blog post feeds, podcast directories, or syndicated content with precise control over RSS semantics.",

      "description": "This module offers functions to define client-side interactive behaviors through htmx attributes like `hx-get`, `hx-swap`, and `hx-sse-connect`, enabling AJAX-driven DOM updates, event-driven partial rendering, and server-sent event integration. It manipulates HTML elements by injecting attributes that accept CSS selectors, raw JavaScript expressions, or unescaped strings\u2014such as `_` and `on`\u2014to control dynamic content loading, form validation workflows, or WebSocket-based real-time interactions. Designed for applications requiring granular control over htmx/Hyperscript-driven UIs without full-page reloads, it pairs with static asset management for efficient script delivery.",

It operates on strings, integers, floats, and variants to produce attributes like `aria-label`, `aria-selected`, `role`, and `aria-valuenow`, which are critical for accessible dynamic UIs such as tables, sortable components, and form controls. These tools enable developers to convey semantic roles",

It provides core data types representing HTML nodes and attributes, allowing operations such as concatenation, filtering, and null checks while ensuring valid XML-style rendering for void tags. You can use it for standalone HTML generation, embedding markup in OCaml applications, or building custom HTML processing pipelines. Submodules extend this functionality with support for MathML equations, type-safe HTML forms, RSS feeds, htmx-driven interactivity, ARIA accessibility attributes, inline SVG graphics, and fundamental HTML tags and attributes.",
