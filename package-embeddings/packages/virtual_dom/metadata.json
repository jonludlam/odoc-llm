      "description": "This module represents keyboard event handlers that combine static and dynamic actions dependent on an environment. It supports operations to add or set variable actions, commands, and disabled keys using functions like `add_variable_actions`, `add_variable_commands`, and `add_variable_disabled_keys`, and allows conversion to a static handler via `to_const_handler`. The `Variable_handler_action` and `Variable_handler_command` types enable environment-dependent behaviors and stable help text generation, making it possible to implement context-sensitive shortcuts that adapt to runtime conditions like UI state or user permissions. Example uses include switching between editing and navigation modes or generating accurate keyboard help documentation in dynamic interfaces.",

It supports structured organization of keybindings into conflict-resolving groups, with conditional activation based on DOM properties and runtime context, allowing shortcuts that adapt to UI state or user permissions. The system tracks keystrokes with modifier support, serializes key sets, and generates customizable help documentation grouped by context or feature, with fine-grained control over rendering and layout. Example uses include context-sensitive keyboard shortcuts, interactive input validation, and dynamically updated help menus styled by command category.",
