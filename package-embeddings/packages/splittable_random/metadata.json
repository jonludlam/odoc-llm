Supports multiple integer types including 32-bit, 63-bit, 64-bit, and native integers.

Custom random state types support creation, copying, perturbation, and splitting into independent streams. Generates biased integers across multiple bit widths, enabling tailored randomness for simulations and edge-case testing. Provides direct control over random sequences, allowing legacy systems to leverage split-based parallelism without cryptographic guarantees.",
