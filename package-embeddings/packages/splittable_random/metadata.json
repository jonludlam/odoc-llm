      "description": "This module generates random integers within specified ranges using a log-uniform distribution, ensuring that the number of bits used to represent the result is chosen uniformly. It supports 32-bit, 63-bit, and 64-bit integer types, along with native integers, making it suitable for applications requiring efficient random number generation with specific bit-width constraints. Use this module when you need random integers with controlled bit-width distribution for simulations, sampling, or randomized algorithms.",

      "description": "This module provides functions to create, copy, split, and modify pseudo-random number generator states. It works with a state type that represents the internal generator state, allowing for operations like splitting a state into independent streams, perturbing a state with an integer, and copying a state. Concrete use cases include generating independent random streams for parallel computations and managing random state in performance-sensitive contexts where cryptographic randomness is not required.",

      "description": "This module implements a high-performance pseudo-random number generator designed for applications requiring independent streams of random values through splitting. It centers around a state type `t` with operations like `split` to create independent states, `perturb` to inject entropy, and functions to generate random booleans, integers, and floats. The log-uniform integer generation supports 32-bit, 63-bit, and 64-bit types, enabling efficient sampling with controlled bit-width distribution. It is ideal for randomized algorithms such as Monte Carlo simulations and property-based testing, where deterministic yet independent random streams are crucial.",
