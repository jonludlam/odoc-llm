It supports low-level time operations such as reading system time, setting timeouts, and manipulating timestamps for files or threads. You can, for example, retrieve the current time, add intervals for scheduling, or set precise sleep durations. Specific uses include handling file modification times and implementing fine-grained timing in concurrent programs.",

It offers functions to create, compare, and modify time instances, supporting operations like adding durations and converting between units. You can measure execution intervals, schedule events, or manage time values for system calls with nanosecond precision. For example, you can compute the difference between two time points or adjust a timestamp by adding a specific duration.",
