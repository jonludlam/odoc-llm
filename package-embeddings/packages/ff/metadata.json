It operates on a prime-order field type `t`, integrating with Zarith integers and bytes for low-level manipulations, while providing utilities for square roots, Legendre symbols, and quadratic residue checks. Its functionality is tailored for cryptographic protocols requiring secure modular arithmetic, such as zero-knowledge proofs or elliptic curve cryptography, with robust handling of edge cases like division by zero or invalid encodings.",
