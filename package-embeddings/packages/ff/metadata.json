      "description": "This module implements arithmetic and serialization for a quadratic finite field extension (degree 2) over a prime-order base field. It operates on field elements represented as type `t`, supporting algebraic operations like addition, multiplication, inversion, exponentiation, and equality checks, along with validation and random generation of non-null elements. These capabilities are particularly useful in cryptographic protocols requiring bilinear pairings or extension field computations, where precise control over field arithmetic and secure serialization is critical.",

It manipulates an abstract type representing field elements and arbitrary-precision integers (`Z.t`), with bidirectional conversions to bytes, integers, and strings. These capabilities are critical for cryptographic protocols relying on modular arithmetic, including elliptic curve cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, and secure multi-party computation systems.",
