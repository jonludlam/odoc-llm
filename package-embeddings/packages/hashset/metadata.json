It provides operations to create, modify, and query sets, including adding or removing elements, checking existence, and traversing or folding over elements. Concrete use cases include tracking unique elements in a collection, implementing fast lookups for algorithms like graph traversal, and managing dynamic sets of keys in applications such as caches or symbol tables.",

      "description": "This module provides a hash table\u2013based set implementation for efficient membership checks, insertion, and removal of elements, supporting arbitrary hashable types through a customizable hash and equality interface. It offers core operations like adding, removing, and checking elements, along with iteration and folding over the set, enabling use cases such as tracking active connections, filtering duplicates in streams, or managing dynamic key sets in caches. The interface for hashable types allows defining custom equality and hashing strategies, while the underlying hash table implementation ensures average constant-time complexity for key operations. Together, these components support fast lookups, deduplication, and scalable set management across varied data-processing scenarios.",
