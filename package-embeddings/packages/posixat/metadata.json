Supports conversion between custom types and Unix representations, enabling structured logging, inter-process communication, and configuration serialization. Specific operations include encoding file descriptors, translating open flags, and serializing permission bits or file metadata. These utilities facilitate safe and readable handling of low-level Unix data in OCaml applications.",
