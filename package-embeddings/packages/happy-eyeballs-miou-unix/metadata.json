      "description": "This module implements connection establishment with Happy Eyeballs algorithm support, handling concurrent IPv4/IPv6 connection attempts and DNS resolution integration. It works with domain names, IP addresses, and Unix file descriptors, providing functions to connect to hosts or pre-resolved IP addresses with configurable timeouts. Concrete use cases include robust client connection handling in network applications where fast fallback between IPv4 and IPv6 is required, and integrating DNS resolution with connection logic in asynchronous Unix-based systems.",
