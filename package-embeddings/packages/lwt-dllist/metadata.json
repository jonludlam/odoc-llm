      "description": "This module provides efficient manipulation of mutable sequences through a doubly-linked list structure, supporting constant-time insertion, removal, and access at both ends. It operates on generic elements encapsulated in nodes, enabling direct node-based operations like safe removal during traversal and value updates, while offering traversal primitives for folding, searching, and transferring elements between sequences. Typical use cases include implementing queues, deques, or algorithms requiring dynamic sequence transformations with guaranteed O(1) time complexity for modifications.",
