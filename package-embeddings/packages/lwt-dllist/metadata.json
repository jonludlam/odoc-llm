It includes predicate-based search capabilities for locating nodes in either direction, returning results via options or exceptions, suitable for dynamic data management scenarios like event queues or real-time processing pipelines. The operations support fine-grained node-level modifications and traversal, ideal for applications requiring frequent structural updates and conditional element access.",
