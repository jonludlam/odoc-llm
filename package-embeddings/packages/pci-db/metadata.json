It supports concrete use cases such as identifying and categorizing PCI devices based on their class, vendor, and device IDs, and enabling structured comparisons between different ID types. The `SUBDEVICE_ID` variant specifically captures composite device-subdevice relationships.",

It operates on a structured in-memory representation of PCI ID data, using types like `Pci_db_types.Id.t`, `classs`, and `vendor`. Concrete use cases include looking up human-readable device information from raw hardware identifiers and merging multiple PCI databases with custom conflict resolution strategies.",
