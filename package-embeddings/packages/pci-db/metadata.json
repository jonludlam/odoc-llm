It provides `to_string` for converting these identifiers to string representations and `compare` for ordering them. These functions support precise handling and comparison of PCI device metadata in parsing and device matching workflows.",

It includes advanced functionality for filtering, predicate-based searches, and transformations with or without key exposure, as well as conversion to and from sequences. It is suited for scenarios requiring ordered manipulation of collections keyed by device identifiers, such as aggregating or analyzing hardware data.",

It supports parsing and querying of PCI database entries for hardware identification, classification, and matching. The `Id` submodule defines a variant type for PCI identifiers and provides comparison and string conversion operations, enabling precise metadata handling. The map structure built around these identifiers allows for ordered data manipulation, filtering, and transformation, suitable for hardware data aggregation and analysis workflows.",

It operates on a structured representation of PCI ID data, using types like `Pci_db_types.Id.t`, `classs`, and `vendor`. Concrete use cases include looking up human-readable device information from raw hardware identifiers and merging multiple PCI databases with custom conflict resolution strategies.",
