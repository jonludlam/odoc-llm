It works with generic OCaml lists and pairs, supporting tasks like indexed data processing, conditional list construction, and efficient ordered operations with tail-recursive optimizations. Specific use cases include handling hierarchical data structures, implementing configuration parsers, and optimizing sequence transformations with controlled iteration.",

It supports standard list types and includes operations like `append_count` for limited concatenation, `map_direct` for direct-order mapping, and `mapi_count` for indexed mapping with a specified count and offset. Concrete use cases include processing bounded data streams, transforming lists with position-dependent functions, and implementing custom traversal logic without relying on default recursion limits.",
