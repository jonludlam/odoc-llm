      "description": "Provides a mechanism to safely manage resources by ensuring their release even when interrupts occur during execution. Operates on arbitrary resource types and functions that acquire, scope, and release them. Used to maintain program consistency when handling memprof callback interruptions, such as in critical sections of code that must not be disrupted.",

Operates with functions that acquire and release resources, using a scope-based execution model. Enables safe handling of resources like file handles or memory blocks within a localized computation.",

Operates on allocation sources, allocation records, and tracker configurations that define how blocks are observed. Used to analyze memory usage patterns in programs with precise control over sampling accuracy and performance impact.",

Operates on threads and tracks resource consumption during execution. Used to enforce strict resource constraints in long-running or untrusted code, such as limiting memory for sandboxed evaluations or capping allocation for iterative algorithms.",

It includes mutable flags for coordination, resource acquisition/release functions with scoped execution, and allocation trackers with customizable sampling and callback mechanisms. It enables tasks such as coordinating asynchronous events, ensuring safe resource cleanup during interruptions, and analyzing memory usage with detailed tracking. Operations include setting and checking flags, wrapping resource operations in safe scopes, and configuring memory allocation monitoring.",
