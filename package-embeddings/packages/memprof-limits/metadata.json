It works with a single abstract data type `t` representing the token. Concrete use cases include signaling between threads, cancellation flags for long-running computations, and synchronization points in concurrent programs.",

It works with any resource type that requires explicit release, such as file handles or memory buffers. Use it to safely manage transient resources within a controlled scope, avoiding leaks even in the presence of exceptions.",

It works with arbitrary types `'a`, `'b`, and `'c` through the provided acquire, scope, and release functions. Use it to protect sensitive allocations or cleanup code from premature interruption, such as when writing to shared state or finalizing resources under memory limits.",

It supports activation and deactivation of profiling via `start` and `stop`, with optional callstack depth control and custom tracking callbacks. Concrete use cases include identifying memory hotspots in long-running applications and diagnosing allocation patterns in performance-critical code paths.",

It provides atomic flags for cross-thread signaling, scoped resource management via `let&` bindings, and safe handling of asynchronous exceptions during critical memory operations. You can interrupt computations that exceed memory thresholds, manage file handles or memory buffers with automatic cleanup, and profile allocations with stack traces to identify performance bottlenecks. Cancellation tokens coordinate task termination, while profiling tools capture detailed allocation data under varying memory pressures.",
