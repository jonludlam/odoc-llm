It provides `start` and `stop` functions to control profiling, along with a `null_tracker` for default callback behavior. Use it to analyze memory usage patterns in applications requiring precise allocation accounting, such as optimizing data structure efficiency or diagnosing memory leaks.",

It works with arbitrary data types through higher-order functions for acquisition, scope, and release. Use it to protect critical sections like file handles or network connections from abrupt termination due to memory or CPU limits.",
