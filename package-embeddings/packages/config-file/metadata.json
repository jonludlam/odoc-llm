It works with a variant type `cp` that represents primitive values like strings, integers, and floats, as well as compound types such as lists, tuples, and nested sections. It is used to load and save configuration files with structured data, enabling direct manipulation of configuration entries before they are wrapped into typed references.",

      "description": "This module manages configuration files composed of structured key-value pairs, supporting nested sections and compound types like lists, tuples, and subgroups. It provides typed configuration parameters through classes such as `groupable_cp` and wrappers for `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, and enumerations, enabling automatic parsing, serialization, and command-line integration. The `cp` variant type represents parsed configuration values, allowing direct manipulation of raw entries before they are bound to typed references. Example usage includes defining configurable options with defaults and help strings, organizing related settings into groups, and persisting application state across sessions.",
