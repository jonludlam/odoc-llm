It supports batch manipulation through sequence-based functions (`add_seq`, `replace_seq`, `of_seq`) for bulk updates or initialization with key-value pairs. Such structures are particularly useful when processing Memtrace files to track or transform metadata associated with specific backtrace patterns during trace analysis or serialization workflows.",
