      "description": "This module handles abstract syntax tree (AST) operations for modeling languages, including type conversions, identifier management, and structured data representation, alongside API specification tasks like HTTP method modeling, endpoint definition, and Swagger document structuring. It works with nested type hierarchies, tokenized syntax elements, and RESTful API components to enable model validation, code generation, and documentation synthesis. Specific use cases include parsing schema definitions, generating API client libraries, and enforcing format constraints in request/response payloads.",
