It supports creating and serializing structures that specify module sources with optional names, hashes, and fetch parameters like headers and HTTP methods. Concrete use cases include constructing manifests that reference Wasm plugins from local files, embedded data, or remote URLs with authentication headers.",

      "description": "This module provides a functional interface for building and manipulating WebAssembly manifests with precise control over memory, configuration, and module sources. It supports key types like `memory_options`, `config`, and `Wasm.t` to define runtime constraints and plugin configurations, enabling use cases such as embedding Wasm modules from files or URLs with custom headers. The child module extends this by handling source definitions and JSON serialization, allowing manifests to be constructed, modified, and persisted with references to local or remote Wasm binaries. Together, they facilitate secure, sandboxed execution environments with strict resource boundaries and configurable plugin loading.",
