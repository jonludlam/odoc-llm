It supports multiple programming languages and configurable submission options such as user ID, experimental mode, and base files. The core functionality works with file representations that can be constructed from strings, file paths, or input channels, enabling efficient handling of large or dynamically generated source data. For example, it allows checking student assignments for code similarity or verifying originality in version-controlled repositories by preparing and submitting structured file content.",
