It works with file metadata and content through `Sihl__.Contract_storage.file` and `Sihl__.Contract_storage.stored` types, handling large object storage in a relational database. Concrete use cases include storing user-uploaded files, retrieving file content for display or processing, and managing file metadata with optional context-based filtering.",

It enables use cases such as handling uploaded files with associated binary data, serializing file information, and managing storage in relational databases via MariaDB or generic base64-encoded representations. The MariaDB submodule supports uploading, downloading, and managing files as large objects, while the base64 submodule handles file storage with raw base64 content and metadata lifecycle operations.",
