It works with file metadata and content through `Sihl__.Contract_storage.file` and `Sihl__.Contract_storage.stored` types, supporting optional and mandatory retrieval, base64 encoding, and lifecycle management. Concrete use cases include storing user-uploaded files, serving file metadata, and managing file content in a relational database.",
