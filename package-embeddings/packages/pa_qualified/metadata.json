It supports transformations like mapping, filtering, and folding, as well as combining maps through merging and unions, with utilities to convert between maps and sequences. Typical use cases include managing hierarchical configurations, aggregating key-value data from streams, and efficiently handling associative collections where string-based lookups are required.",

It supports creating, comparing, and manipulating identifiers in scoped environments, such as those found in compilers or interpreters. The string map submodule provides transformations, unions, and sequence conversions for hierarchical key-value data, while the AST traversal submodule generates helper names and rewrites OCaml syntax during compilation. Together, these components facilitate complex symbol management, code analysis, and transformation workflows.",
