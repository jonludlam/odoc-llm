It provides functions for safe value retrieval, predicate-based filtering, and conversion between sequences and maps, with support for comparison and transformation. This is useful for scenarios requiring structured key-value data management, such as configuration handling or data aggregation with ordered processing.",

It works directly with AST structures from the `AstFilters.Ast` module, including expressions, patterns, types, and module constructs. Concrete use cases include rewriting qualified identifiers and tracking their locations during syntax transformations in OCaml AST filters.",
