Works with raw audio data represented as arrays of floating-point numbers. Used to convert audio files between different sampling rates while maintaining quality during playback or processing.",

Operates on float arrays and bigarrays, supporting both in-place and allocated buffer processing. Processes audio streams with adjustable ratios, suitable for real-time resampling or batch processing of audio files.",
